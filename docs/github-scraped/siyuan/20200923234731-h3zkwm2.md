# Frequently Asked Questions

## How does SiYuan store data?

The data is saved in the workspace folder (the default is in the user's home directory Documents/SiYuan, which can be modified in <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>About</kbd>), in the workspace data folder:

- `assets` are used to save all inserted assets
- `templates` are used to save template snippets
- `widgets` are used to save widgets
- `emojis` are used to save emoji images
- The rest of the folders are the notebook folders created by the user, files with the suffix of `.sy` in the notebook folder are used to save the document data, and the data format is JSON

## Is there any Note for deleting docs?

After deletion, the doc will not appear in the operating system's recycle bin, but will be deleted directly. When deleted, SiYuan will generate data history.

## How can I just wrap and not start a new paragraph?

Please use <kbd>Shift+Enter</kbd>.

## How to move the heading and blocks below it?

Fold the heading and move it later. Please note that it is a move, not a cut, and a folded heading cut will not move the blocks below it.

## How to select multiple blocks across pages?

Click at the beginning, hold down <kbd>Shift</kbd> and click at the end after scrolling the page.

## How to adjust table rows and columns?

There is an operation entry in the block icon menu of the table block.

## What if some blocks (such as paragraph blocks in list items) cannot find the block icon?

The first sub-block under the list item is the block icon omitted. You can move the cursor into this block and trigger its block menu with <kbd>Ctrl+/</kbd> .

## How to search for content containing symbols?

If you need to search for content containing symbols (`-`, `*`, etc.), you need to use `"` to wrap keywords, such as `"-siyuan"`. For details, please refer to Query syntax.

## How to use a third-party sync disk for data synchronization?

- Please only synchronize the `workspace/data/`, do not synchronize the entire workspace
- Please suspend third-party synchronization during the operation of SiYuan, otherwise data may be damaged. For details, please refer to [here](https://ld246.com/article/1626537583158)
- The data folder path on the Android is `internal storage device/Android/data/org.b3log.siyuan/files/siyuan/data/`, which is a private path of the application and cannot be read by other programs and can only be copied manually
- There is a conflict between third-party synchronization and SiYuan synchronization, please do not use at the same time

## What should I do if I forget the end-to-end password?

1. Use the new workspace on the main device, manually copy the old workspace data folder to the new workspace
2. New workspace can reset password
3. The cloud uses the new cloud synchronization directory

If it is a mobile-end, uninstall and reinstall it (Note: When the mobile-enduninstalls the application, the local workspace data will be deleted together).

## Do I need to pay for it?

Local functions are completely free to use, [Cloud services](https://b3log.org/siyuan/pricing.html) requires annual subscription, price is $72/year。

Users in non-Mainland China regions should not pay for subscriptions, because SiYuan Cloud Server cannot guarantee availability in non-Mainland China regions.
