# Data Security

## Overview

Data security is mainly divided into two aspects:

- Availability: no data loss, no conflict, keep the data complete and consistent
- Confidentiality: data will not be leaked or tampered with

SiYuan supports both of these aspects. The following is an explanation about data security.

## Plaintext storage

SiYuan uses plaintext to store data on the local file system, which means:

- Anyone or software who can use the operating system can read the data in it
- The availability of data depends on the availability of hardware disks and operating systems

## End-to-end encryption

SiYuan cloud backup and synchronization use end-to-end encryption, the password is stored locally with a built-in key encryption, any third party other than the user cannot get the plaintext in the cloud data.

## Suggest

- Regularly back up data to the cloud and offline devices at the same time
- It is recommended to use special software, equipment or offline storage for important passwords, keys or core secrets
