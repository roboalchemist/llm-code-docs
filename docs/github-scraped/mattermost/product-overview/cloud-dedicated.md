# Cloud Dedicated

Mattermost Cloud Dedicated is designed for larger organizations with
higher demands for performance, scalability, customizability, and
compliance looking to offload operational overhead and focus on more
business-critical tasks.

Your own private Mattermost instance running
`Mattermost Enterprise </product-overview/editions-and-offerings>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} is a Kubernetes cluster hosted and managed by Mattermost
that runs on dedicated cloud infrastructure, where resources are
exclusively available for your organization.

## Reference architecture

![An architecture diagram showing the components of the Mattermost Cloud Dedicated solution.](../images/mattermost-cloud-dedicated-reference-architecture.png)

## Available features

### Zero-downtime upgrades

Mattermost releases biweekly updates and leverages recurring maintenance
windows to keep your instance up-to-date with new stable or beta
features behind feature flags, fix security issues, and ensure the
overall reliability and performance of your environment. Maintenance
windows are announced in advance on <https://status.mattermost.com/>

Additional support options, including quicker response times, dedicated
support personnel, and stronger service level agreements (SLAs), are
also available.

### Disaster Recovery

Mattermost Cloud Dedicated supports data failover to a secondary
region/site should the primary instance experiences an unrecoverable
outage with guaranteed recovery times.

Mattermost supports a **multi-AZ (availability zones)** strategy in the
same site/region.

Daily backups of the database, object storage, and high availability
clusters are captured and retained for 30 days.

In addition, highly available observability tools with automated
alerting, long-term metrics, and logs retention are retained for a
duration of 1 year, or longer, if requred.

### Security

You have access to all the resources required to run the Mattermost
application with the highest security standards, including data
encryption at rest and in transit.

Your pre-configured cluster is secure by default, based on industry best
practices including Data encryption at rest and in transit, TLS
certificates life cycle management, and automatic security updates.

Mattermost maintains control over network and security policies,
including [encryption](#encryption), database, data, object storage,
backup schedules, and compliance certifications.

### Authentication and authorization

Mattermost offers advanced security and authentication options for
integrating with corporate directories, including
`Active Directory/LDAP </administration-guide/onboard/ad-ldap>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"},
`Okta </administration-guide/onboard/sso-saml-okta>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"},
`OneLogin </administration-guide/onboard/sso-saml-onelogin>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"},
`SAML </administration-guide/onboard/sso-saml>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"},
`Google </administration-guide/onboard/sso-google>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"},
`EntraID </administration-guide/onboard/sso-entraid>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, and
`OpenID </administration-guide/onboard/sso-openidconnect>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

### Secure networking

Mattermost Cloud Dedicated supports
`IP filtering </administration-guide/manage/cloud-ip-filtering>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} through CIDR-based IP ranges, providing flexibility for
system administrators to include various authorized IPs or IP ranges for
seamless access control. Users attempting to access their
`workspace </end-user-guide/end-user-guide-index>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} from IPs outside defined ranges are restricted from entry.
Cloud system admins can
`configure IP filtering <administration-guide/manage/cloud-ip-filtering:configure ip filtering>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} through their Mattermost System Console.

### Encryption

Mattermost provides encryption-in-transit and encryption-at-rest
capabilities. Mattermost supports
`TLS encryption </deployment-guide/server/setup-tls>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, including AES-256 with 2048-bit RSA on all data
transmissions, between Mattermost client applications and the Mattermost
server. You may either set up TLS on the Mattermost Server or
`install a proxy such as NGINX </deployment-guide/server/setup-nginx-proxy>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, and set up TLS on the proxy.

Connections to
`Active Directory/LDAP </administration-guide/onboard/ad-ldap>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} can
`optionally be secured with TLS or stunnel <administration-guide/configure/authentication-configuration-settings:ad/ldap port>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Connections to calls are secured with a combination of:

- TLS: The existing WebSocket channel is used to secure the signaling
  path.
- DTLS v1.2 (mandatory): Used for initial key exchange. Supports
  `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256` and
  `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA` algorithms.
- SRTP (mandatory): Used to encrypt all media packets (i.e. those
  containing voice or screen share). Supports `AEAD_AES_128_GCM` and
  `AES128_CM_HMAC_SHA1_80` algorithms.

### Cloud native exports

Mattermost supports optional
`filestore configuration settings <administration-guide/configure/environment-configuration-settings:enable dedicated export filestore target>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to direct compliance and bulk export data to a separate S3
bucket from standard files. This separate bucket can be configured to
allow for secure access by Mattermost Cloud teams as well as admins who
manage a given Mattermost deployment. The exports can also be accessed
by generating unique download links as needed.

The following diagram provides a high-level view of how this
functionality works:

### SMTP

Email sent from Mattermost Cloud Dedicated uses SendGrid, and the
connection to SendGrid is encrypted.

### Audit and observability

Mattermost Cloud Dedicated provides access to
`audit and system logs </administration-guide/manage/logging>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} generated by the application.

### Customization

The following Mattermost plugins are available for cloud-based
deployments:

\-
`Microsoft Teams Sync </integrations-guide/microsoft-teams-sync>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} -
`Microsoft Calendar Integration </integrations-guide/microsoft-calendar>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} -
`Microsoft Teams Meetings </integrations-guide/microsoft-teams-meetings>`{.interpreted-text
