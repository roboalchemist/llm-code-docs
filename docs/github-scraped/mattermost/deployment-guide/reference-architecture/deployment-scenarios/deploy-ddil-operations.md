# Deploy for Enterprise to Edge DDIL Operations

## Overview

Disconnected, Denied, Intermittent, and Limited (DDIL) network
conditions present unique challenges for enterprise-to-edge operations.
Field operations, remote deployments, and edge environments often become
temporarily isolated from the internet, interrupting direct access to
Microsoft 365 services such as Teams and Outlook.

Mattermost enables resilient collaboration by remaining fully
operational in DDIL environments. Mission users continue to access
self-hosted messaging collaboration, workflow automation, and mission
planning within their mobile tactical network. No internet connectivity
is required for enhanced collaboration functions, including mission
tuned AI agents powered by self-hosted LLMs, and audio and screen
sharing services.

When connectivity is restored, mission users regain access to M365
enterprise systems in addition to collaboration continuity with
enterprise users through the
`embedded Mattermost experience </integrations-guide/mattermost-mission-collaboration-for-m365>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} inside their Microsoft Teams and Outlook applications. All
mission activity during the period of disconnection becomes available
across enterprise and tactical environments when connectivity returns.

Traditional cloud-only solutions fail in these scenarios, while fully
disconnected systems don\'t integrate with enterprise tools during
normal operations. This deployment architecture
`extends sovereign collaboration with Microsoft Teams and Outlook </deployment-guide/reference-architecture/deployment-scenarios/deploy-sovereign-collaboration>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} to the tactical edge, providing a hybrid solution that
enables enterprise integration and fully disconnected tactical
collaboration.

## Architecture components

This hybrid deployment architecture provides optimal collaboration in
both connected and disconnected states, including:

- **Enterprise Network:** Network containing enterprise services and
  continuous access to Microsoft 365. The network may have a firewall or
  access gateway protecting egress and ingress, such as network
  policies, IP allowlists, or WAFs depending on your networking
  configurations.
- **Enterprise Users:** Users within the enterprise network boundary
  accessing client applications for M365 services and Mattermost.
- **Tactical Network:** Operates independently during internet
  disconnections, hosting a self-contained Mattermost deployment to
  ensure mission users maintain collaboration capabilities.
- **Mission Users:** Tactical or edge users who may be intermittently
  disconnected from enterprise systems and Microsoft services.
- **Identity Providers:**
  - **Microsoft Entra ID:** Enterprise users authenticate to M365
    applications and Mattermost using
    `single sign-on Entra ID </administration-guide/onboard/sso-entraid>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} via OpenID Connect (OIDC) or SAML. This provider only
    works with functioning internet access.
  - **Alternative Local Identity Provider:** Deployed within the
    tactical network to provide authentication services for mission
    users during disconnected periods when M365 is unreachable. The
    local IdP serves as the primary authentication source for Mattermost
    and maintains an independent user directory that operates without
    internet connectivity.
- **Client Applications:**
  - **Microsoft 365 Desktop Apps:** Teams and Outlook with
    `embedded Mattermost application. </integrations-guide/mattermost-mission-collaboration-for-m365>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"}
    - When internet connected: Enables seamless enterprise-to-edge
      collaboration within a familiar interface.
    - When internet disconnected: Microsoft services are unreachable,
      but embedded Mattermost application remains fully operational for
      tactical teams.
  - **Mattermost Desktop Apps:** Access Mattermost via
    `desktop </deployment-guide/desktop/desktop-app-deployment>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} or web apps in addition to the embedded views from Teams
    and Outlook. *(Optional - not shown)*
  - **Mattermost Mobile Apps:** Access Mattermost via
    `iPhone and Android apps </deployment-guide/mobile/mobile-app-deployment>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"}, with support for
    `ID-only push notifications </deployment-guide/mobile/host-your-own-push-proxy-service>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} to ensure compliance with data sovereignty requirements.
    *(Optional when connectivity permits - not shown)*
- **Mattermost Deployment:** Mattermost deployed for sovereign tactical
  collaboration on local infrastructure, such as [Azure
  Local](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-local/manage/disconnected-operations-overview),
  supporting data residency regulations and
  `disconnected operations </deployment-guide/reference-architecture/deployment-scenarios/air-gapped-deployment>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}. See
  `reference architecture </administration-guide/scale/server-architecture>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} documentation for Mattermost deployment configurations
  based on expected scale.
  - **Mattermost Server:** Core application server handling tactical
    collaboration workloads, including:
    - `Messaging Collaboration </end-user-guide/messaging-collaboration>`{.interpreted-text
      role="doc"}: DDIL-ready 1:1, group messaging, and structured
      channel collaboration with
      `rich integration capabilities </integrations-guide/integrations-guide-index>`{.interpreted-text
      role="doc"} and
      `enterprise-grade search <administration-guide/scale/scaling-for-enterprise:enterprise search>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"}.
    - `Workflow Automation </end-user-guide/workflow-automation>`{.interpreted-text
      role="doc"}: Playbooks provide structure, monitoring and
      automation for repeatable processes built-in to your local
      Mattermost deployment.
    - `Project Tracking </end-user-guide/project-task-management>`{.interpreted-text
      role="doc"}: Boards enables project management capabilities
      built-in to your local Mattermost deployment.
    - `AI Agents </administration-guide/configure/agents-admin-guide>`{.interpreted-text
      role="doc"}: AI Agents run against a local LLM hosted within your
      tactical network.
    - `Audio & Screenshare </administration-guide/configure/calls-deployment>`{.interpreted-text
      role="doc"}: Calls offers native real-time self-hosted audio calls
      and screen sharing within your tactical network.
  - **Proxy Server:** The
    `proxy server </deployment-guide/server/setup-nginx-proxy>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} handles HTTP(S) routing within the cluster, directing
    traffic between the server and clients accessing Mattermost
    services. NGINX is recommended for load balancing with support for
    WebSocket connections, health check endpoints, and sticky sessions.
    The proxy layer provides SSL termination and distributes client
    traffic across application servers.
  - **PostgreSQL Database:** Stores persistent application data on a
    `PostgreSQL v13+ database </deployment-guide/server/preparations>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} hosted locally within your tactical network.
  - **Object Storage:** File uploads, images, and attachments are stored
    outside the application node on an
    `S3-compatible store </deployment-guide/server/preparations>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} or network/local storage, hosted locally within your
    tactical network.
  - **Recording Instance:** `calls-offloader`
    `job service <administration-guide/configure/calls-deployment:configure recording, transcriptions, and live captions>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} to offload heavy processing tasks from Mattermost Calls
    to self-hosted infrastructure within your tactical network, such as
    recordings, transcriptions, and live captioning. *(Optional)*
- **Self-hosted integrations:**
  `Custom apps, plugins, and webhooks </integrations-guide/integrations-guide-index>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} can be deployed within your tactical network. *(Optional -
  not shown)*
- **Self-hosted LLM:** Locally hosted
  `OpenAI compatible LLM </agents/docs/providers>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} for agentic powered collaboration within your tactical
  network. *(Optional)*
- **Microsoft Global Network:** [World-wide
  network](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/networking/microsoft-global-network)
  of Microsoft data centers, delivering public cloud services when
  internet connectivity permits.

## Operational Best Practices

The following best practices and deployment configurations help ensure
that Mattermost remains compliant and operationally resilient in
contested environments.

### User Authentication

DDIL environments require authentication infrastructure that remains
fully operational without internet connectivity. Relying solely on
cloud-based identity providers like Microsoft Entra ID creates a
critical single point of failure when tactical networks become
disconnected. To ensure mission users maintain authentication
capabilities, deploy a locally hosted identity provider within the
tactical network.

- **Enterprise Users:** Access Teams and Outlook by authenticating to
  Microsoft 365 via Entra ID, and their M365 session also provides
  access to the embedded Mattermost experience when the tactical network
  is internet connected.
- **Mission users:** Authenticate to Mattermost using a local IdP, such
  as
  `Keycloak </administration-guide/onboard/sso-saml-keycloak>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} (open-source IdP with OIDC/SAML support), Active Directory
  with ADFS, or OpenLDAP with an OIDC bridge. When internet connected,
  the local IdP can optionally federate with Microsoft Entra ID to
  synchronize user accounts, credentials, and group memberships to
  enable access to Microsoft applications.

User accounts must be provisioned in the local IdP before disconnection
occurs to ensure authentication services remain available throughout
DDIL conditions.

### Sovereign AI

Deploy an
`OpenAI compatible LLM </administration-guide/configure/agents-admin-guide>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} on tactical infrastructure to ensure AI capabilities remain
fully sovereign and operational in disconnected scenarios. A self-hosted
LLM can power
`message and call summarization, semantic search <end-user-guide/agents:analyze threads and channels>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, and
`mission-tuned AI agents <administration-guide/configure/agents-admin-guide:agent configuration>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} without relying on public cloud AI services. This guarantees
compliance with strict data handling mandates and enables AI-enhanced
workflows to function locally, even during extended disconnections.

### Self-hosted audio & screensharing

Effective collaboration at the tactical edge requires all voice and
screen sharing capabilities remain operational without reliance on the
internet or third-party services. Deploy
`Mattermost Calls </administration-guide/configure/calls-deployment>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} in a self-hosted configuration, including:

- The
  `rtcd service <administration-guide/configure/calls-deployment:the rtcd service>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} for scalable, low-latency media routing hosted
  on-premises. Run multiple `rtcd` nodes for redundancy.
- The
  `calls offloader <administration-guide/configure/calls-deployment:configure recording, transcriptions, and live captions>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} service offloads heavy processing tasks like recording,
  transcription and live captioning to a locally hosted
  compliance-approved job server.

### High availability and fault tolerance

Deploy Mattermost in a
`cluster-based architecture </administration-guide/scale/high-availability-cluster-based-deployment>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} to ensure continued availability during outages or hardware
failures. High availability requires redundant infrastructure across
each critical component:

- Application servers: Scale horizontally across multiple nodes with a
  load balancer distributing client traffic.
- Search service:
  `Elasticsearch or AWS OpenSearch Service <administration-guide/scale/scaling-for-enterprise:enterprise search>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} provides optimized search performance with dedicated
  indexing for large-scale deployments.
- Object storage: Configure S3-compatible backends with erasure coding
  or replication for durability. All application servers must access
  shared file storage (NAS or S3) to ensure consistent data
  availability.
- Calls services: Run multiple `rtcd` and offloader nodes for
  resilience.

### Compliance and retention

Sovereign environments often require strict enforcement of retention
policies, legal hold, and export controls. Configure Mattermost\'s
built-in compliance features to meet organizational mandates.

- Enable
  `compliance export </administration-guide/comply/compliance-export>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} and
  `monitoring </administration-guide/comply/compliance-monitoring>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} to produce auditable exports of message data and user
  activity logs.
- Configure
  `message retention </administration-guide/comply/data-retention-policy>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} and
  `legal hold </administration-guide/comply/legal-hold>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} policies to align with applicable regulations.
- Integrate with your organization\'s
  `eDiscovery </administration-guide/comply/electronic-discovery>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} and archiving systems as required.
