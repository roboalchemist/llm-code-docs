# Deploy for Sovereign Collaboration in Microsoft

## Overview

Agencies and critical infrastructure organizations often face strict
data sovereignty requirements that restrict the use of public cloud
services for sensitive collaboration.

Deploying Mattermost for sovereign collaboration within Microsoft Teams
and Outlook enables secure, compliant, and resilient communication while
maintaining workflow continuity inside familiar Microsoft interfaces.
Users access both Teams channels and Mattermost channels
`from within the Microsoft ecosystem </integrations-guide/mattermost-mission-collaboration-for-m365>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, providing a single-pane-of-glass experience and eliminating
application switching.

Mattermost can be hosted on-premises or in sovereign clouds, such as
Azure GovCloud or Azure Local, ensuring that messages, files,
recordings, and transcriptions remain in compliance-approved systems
with encryption and strict policy enforcement.

Unified authentication with Microsoft Entra-ID extends your Microsoft
enterprise IT investments while delivering the compliance, control, and
resilience required for mission-critical operations or out-of-band
scenarios.

This document outlines architectural guidance for enabling sovereign
collaboration within your Microsoft ecosystem.

## Architecture components

The deployment architecture includes the following components:

- **Users:** Enterprise users within the network boundary accessing
  client applications for M365 services and Mattermost.
- **Microsoft Entra ID (Identity Provider):** Users authenticate to M365
  applications and Mattermost using
  `single sign-on Entra ID </administration-guide/onboard/sso-entraid>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} via OpenID Connect (OIDC) or SAML.
- **Client Applications:**
  - **Microsoft 365 Desktop Apps:** Teams and Outlook with
    `embedded Mattermost application </integrations-guide/mattermost-mission-collaboration-for-m365>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} for seamless collaboration within a familiar interface
    while enforcing regulatory compliance.
  - **Mattermost Desktop Apps:** Access Mattermost via
    `desktop </deployment-guide/desktop/desktop-app-deployment>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} or web apps in addition to the embedded views from Teams
    and Outlook. *(Optional - not shown)*
  - **Mattermost Mobile Apps:** Access Mattermost via
    `iPhone and Android apps </deployment-guide/mobile/mobile-app-deployment>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"}, with support for
    `ID-only push notifications </deployment-guide/mobile/host-your-own-push-proxy-service>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} to ensure compliance with data sovereignty requirements.
    *(Optional - not shown)*
- **Mattermost Deployment:** Mattermost deployed for sovereign
  collaboration on enterprise-controlled infrastructure or private
  cloud, such as
  `Azure </deployment-guide/server/deploy-kubernetes>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} or [Azure
  Local](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-local/manage/disconnected-operations-overview),
  to maintain compliance with STIG, FedRAMP, and NIST 800-53 standards.
  See
  `reference architecture </administration-guide/scale/server-architecture>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} documentation for Mattermost deployment configurations
  based on expected scale.
  - **Mattermost Server:** Core application server handling
    collaboration workloads, including:
    - `Messaging Collaboration </end-user-guide/messaging-collaboration>`{.interpreted-text
      role="doc"}: DDIL-ready 1:1, group messaging, and structured
      channel collaboration with
      `rich integration capabilities </integrations-guide/integrations-guide-index>`{.interpreted-text
      role="doc"} and
      `enterprise-grade search <administration-guide/scale/scaling-for-enterprise:enterprise search>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"}.
    - `Workflow Automation </end-user-guide/workflow-automation>`{.interpreted-text
      role="doc"}: Playbooks provide structure, monitoring and
      automation for repeatable processes built-in to your sovereign
      Mattermost deployment.
    - `Project Tracking </end-user-guide/project-task-management>`{.interpreted-text
      role="doc"}: Boards enables project management capabilities
      built-in to your sovereign Mattermost deployment.
    - `AI Agents </administration-guide/configure/agents-admin-guide>`{.interpreted-text
      role="doc"}: AI Agents run against Azure OpenAI endpoints or a
      self-hosted LLM that is OpenAI-compatible.
    - `Audio & Screenshare </administration-guide/configure/calls-deployment>`{.interpreted-text
      role="doc"}: Calls offers native real-time self-hosted audio calls
      and screen sharing within your own network.
  - **Proxy Server:** The
    `proxy server </deployment-guide/server/setup-nginx-proxy>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} handles HTTP(S) routing within the cluster, directing
    traffic between the server and clients accessing Mattermost
    services. NGINX is recommended for load balancing with support for
    WebSocket connections, health check endpoints, and sticky sessions.
    The proxy layer provides SSL termination and distributes client
    traffic across application servers.
  - **PostgreSQL Database:** Stores persistent application data on a
    `PostgreSQL v13+ database </deployment-guide/server/preparations>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"}, such as [Azure Database for
    PostgreSQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/postgresql).
  - **Object Storage:** File uploads, images, and attachments are stored
    outside the application node on an
    `S3-compatible store </deployment-guide/server/preparations>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} or an NFS (Network File System) server. [Azure Blob
    Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs)
    can be used, but needs an S3-compatible proxy for Mattermost to
    interface with.
  - **Recording Instance:** `calls-offloader`
    `job service <administration-guide/configure/calls-deployment:configure recording, transcriptions, and live captions>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} to offload heavy processing tasks from Mattermost Calls,
    such as recordings, transcriptions, and live captioning, to
    enterprise-controlled infrastructure or private cloud. *(Optional)*
- **Self-hosted integrations:**
  `Custom apps, plugins, and webhooks </integrations-guide/integrations-guide-index>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} can be deployed within the enterprise boundary.
  *(Optional - not shown)*

**Secure Access Layer:** A firewall or access gateway protecting entry
into the enterprise network. This may include network policies, IP
allowlists, or WAFs depending on your networking configurations.
*(Optional)*

**Microsoft Global Network:** [World-wide
network](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/networking/microsoft-global-network)
of Microsoft data centers, delivering public cloud services including
M365 and Azure OpenAI.

**Azure OpenAI Service:**
`LLM service </agents/docs/providers>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
used for summarization, ai-enhanced search, and agent-assisted
workflows, hosted within the Microsoft Global Network. *(Optional)*

## Operational Best Practices

The following best practices and deployment configurations help ensure
that Mattermost remains compliant, resilient, and fully sovereign when
deployed alongside Microsoft 365.

### High availability and fault tolerance

Deploy Mattermost in a
`cluster-based architecture </administration-guide/scale/high-availability-cluster-based-deployment>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} to ensure continued availability during outages or hardware
failures. High availability requires redundant infrastructure across
each critical component:

- Application servers: Scale horizontally across multiple nodes with a
  load balancer distributing client traffic.
- Database layer: Use PostgreSQL replication or managed HA services with
  automatic failover.
- Search service:
  `Elasticsearch or AWS OpenSearch Service <administration-guide/scale/scaling-for-enterprise:enterprise search>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} provides optimized search performance with dedicated
  indexing for large-scale deployments.
- Object storage: Configure S3-compatible backends with erasure coding
  or replication for durability. All application servers must access
  shared file storage (NAS or S3) to ensure consistent data
  availability.
- Calls services: Run multiple `rtcd` and `calls-offloader` nodes for
  resilience.

### Sovereign audio & screensharing

Data sovereignty compliance may require that all voice and screen
sharing traffic remain within enterprise-controlled infrastructure and
does not traverse third-party services. Deploy
`Mattermost Calls </administration-guide/configure/calls-deployment>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} in a self-hosted configuration to ensure that Microsoft
Teams users and Mattermost users collaborate without media ever leaving
the sovereign network.

- The
  `rtcd service <administration-guide/configure/calls-deployment:the rtcd service>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} for scalable, low-latency media routing hosted
  on-premises. Run multiple `rtcd` nodes for redundancy.
- The
  `calls offloader <administration-guide/configure/calls-deployment:configure recording, transcriptions, and live captions>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} service offloads heavy processing tasks like recording,
  transcription and live captioning to a compliance-approved job server.

### Compliance and retention

Sovereign environments often require strict enforcement of retention
policies, legal hold, and export controls. Configure Mattermost\'s
built-in compliance features to meet agency or sectoral mandates.

- Enable
  `compliance export </administration-guide/comply/compliance-export>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} and
  `monitoring </administration-guide/comply/compliance-monitoring>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} to produce auditable exports of message data and user
  activity logs.
- Configure
  `message retention </administration-guide/comply/data-retention-policy>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} and
  `legal hold </administration-guide/comply/legal-hold>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} policies to align with applicable regulations.
- Integrate with your organization\'s
  `eDiscovery </administration-guide/comply/electronic-discovery>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} and archiving systems as required.

### Mobile notifications

To prevent sensitive message content from being transmitted to external
notification services such as Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) and
Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), configure Mattermost to use
`ID-only push notifications </deployment-guide/mobile/host-your-own-push-proxy-service>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. In this configuration, only a message identifier is sent to
public push notification services and the client retrieves the content
securely from the Mattermost server over an encrypted channel.
