# Deployment Scenarios

This section outlines reference architectures and guidance tailored for
specialized Mattermost deployment scenarios, enabling organizations to
build secure, compliant, and resilient collaboration environments across
diverse operational contexts.

Whether you're implementing out-of-band communications, mission partner
collaboration, sovereign collaboration within Microsoft ecosystems, or
mission-critical operations at the edge, these architectures offer
comprehensive guidance, design patterns, and best practices to ensure
robust and reliable deployments.
