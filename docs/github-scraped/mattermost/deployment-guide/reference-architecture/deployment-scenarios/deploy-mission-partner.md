# Deploy for Mission Partner Collaboration

## Overview

Mission partner collaboration extends
`sovereign collaboration </deployment-guide/reference-architecture/deployment-scenarios/deploy-sovereign-collaboration>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} and
`edge deployment </deployment-guide/reference-architecture/deployment-scenarios/deploy-ddil-operations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} models to enable joint and allied operations across
organizations using Mattermost, Microsoft 365 and legacy platforms. The
solution architecture outlined in this document delivers a secure,
sovereign, and intelligent mission environment that is federated across
enterprise and coalition partner networks, enabling interoperability
while maintaining compliance and control.

Joint mission collaboration is achieved through federation using
`connected workspaces </administration-guide/onboard/connected-workspaces>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, [Matrix
connectors](https://mattermost.com/marketplace/mattermost-matrix-connector/),
`guest accounts </administration-guide/onboard/guest-accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, and
[auto-translation](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-channel-translations)
for fast, accurate comprehension across globally distributed teams.
Additionally, integrating external data feeds, workflow automation, and
sovereign AI enables allied and partner users to collaborate at mission
speed while enforcing zero-trust policies and maintaining data
sovereignty.

Mattermost deployments may be hosted on-premises or in sovereign clouds,
enabling allies and partners to retain control over sensitive data while
extending interoperability to coalition partner enterprise networks.

## Collaboration challenges

Multi-agency collaborations face complex communication challenges:

- **Platform diversity:** Organizations often use different platforms,
  including Microsoft 365, Mattermost, and Matrix - with some using
  Teams for enterprise productivity
  `supplemented with Mattermost </deployment-guide/reference-architecture/deployment-scenarios/deploy-sovereign-collaboration>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} for sovereign collaboration, data residency, and offline
  resilience.
- **External access:** External partners need controlled access without
  full organizational membership.
- **Language barriers:** Organizations may speak different languages.
- **Compliance:** Data residency and compliance requirements vary across
  organizations.

## Solution Architecture

Traditional solutions require everyone to adopt the same platform or use
insecure external tools. Mattermost powers a multi-layer approach
addressing these collaboration challenges and diverse organizational
needs, including:

- **Mattermost ↔ Mattermost Collaboration:** Organizations with
  Mattermost deployments establish secure connections and share specific
  channels using
  `connected workspaces </administration-guide/onboard/connected-workspaces>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} over standard HTTPS/VPN.
- **External users ↔ Mattermost Collaboration:** Users from external
  organizations receive Mattermost
  `guest accounts </administration-guide/onboard/guest-accounts>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} with least-privilege access. External users in Microsoft
  environments may access Mattermost using the
  `embedded application </integrations-guide/mattermost-mission-collaboration-for-m365>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} in their Teams and Outlook clients.
- **Matrix / XMPP ↔ Mattermost Collaboration:** Organizations using
  legacy XMPP systems or Matrix servers connect to Mattermost via the
  [Matrix bridge
  plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-matrix-bridge)
  for bidirectional communication.
- **Automatic Language Translation:** The AI-powered [automatic
  translation
  plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-channel-translations)
  enables seamless communication across language barriers in channels
  with distributed teams.

## Operational Best Practices

The following best practices and deployment configurations help ensure
that Mattermost remains secure, resilient, and interoperable across
federated mission partner environments.

### Network Configuration

When external access is enabled through various federation capabilities,
it is recommended to deploy Mattermost in a DMZ rather than on the
internal network. This approach provides defense-in-depth and preserves
security boundaries by isolating each connected server deployment from
the enterprise network.

- **DMZ Deployment:** Position Mattermost application servers in the DMZ
  network segment, allowing both internal users and external partner
  federation traffic to access the collaboration platform through
  controlled network boundaries.
- **VPN Termination:** Terminate site-to-site VPN connections at the
  network perimeter or DMZ layer, enabling encrypted partner
  connectivity without exposing internal network infrastructure. VPN
  tunnels establish secure communication channels between partner
  organizations over the internet.
- **Firewall Segmentation:** Deploy ingress and egress firewall rules to
  control traffic flow between the DMZ, internal network, and external
  partner networks. Restrict database and object storage access to only
  originate from the DMZ segment where Mattermost servers reside.
- **Federation Traffic Isolation:** Partner federation traffic
  (Connected workspaces synchronize over HTTPS port 443/TCP) remains
  isolated within the DMZ, protecting internal systems while enabling
  partner collaboration and enforcing zero-trust principles across
  organizational boundaries.

### Resilient federation for joint operations

`Connected workspaces </administration-guide/onboard/connected-workspaces>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} allow federated collaboration across multiple organizations
and networks while maintaining local data control of each Mattermost
deployment. Messages, threads, and files are securely synchronized
between environments, ensuring mission continuity for multinational
operations without requiring partners to join a single centralized
deployment.

- Enforce
  `zero-trust access <administration-guide/onboard/connected-workspaces:create a secure connection>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} and ensure that only authorized mission partners can view
  or contribute to shared collaboration channels.
- Configure
  [auto-translation](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-channel-translations)
  in shared channels for seamless multilingual cross-domain
  collaboration.
- Mattermost instances can operate independently during outages or
  intermittent connectivity and sync conversations once connectivity
  returns.

Many mission partners continue to operate on legacy systems such as
Matrix and XMPP. To enable joint operations without forcing migration,
Mattermost supports [secure
interoperability](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-matrix-bridge)
with these environments for continuity of coalition communications while
allowing modernized workflows to extend across federated networks.

Synchronize Mattermost channels with Matrix or XMPP rooms, allowing
messages, threads, and attachments to flow across systems in real-time.
Each organization maintains control of its data and infrastructure,
while interoperability is enabled through federation bridges rather than
centralized services.

### Controlled external access

Mission partner collaboration may require involving external users such
as allied forces, contractors, or coalition partners that do not have
Mattermost deployments themselves.
`Guest accounts </administration-guide/onboard/guest-accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} provide a controlled mechanism to enable these users to
participate in joint mission operations while maintaining strict
compliance and security boundaries.

- Guest accounts are restricted to specific teams and channels. This
  ensures external users only have access to mission-critical resources
  necessary for their role.
- Guests can be granted access to shared channels, enabling
  collaboration with additional trusted organizations through
  `connected workspaces </administration-guide/onboard/connected-workspaces>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}.
- Guest users can be provided VPN credentials that allow them to connect
  specifically to the DMZ network segment where Mattermost resides. This
  architecture ensures external guests can access the collaboration
  platform without gaining access to internal corporate resources,
  files, or systems.

### Zero-trust access controls

Mission partner collaboration environments should adopt zero-trust
principles by implementing
`attribute-based access control (ABAC) </administration-guide/manage/admin/attribute-based-access-control>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} to ensure access to mission channels is governed by dynamic
attributes such as role, clearance, location, and mission context.

- Restrict channel access based on
  `user attributes </administration-guide/manage/admin/user-attributes>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} rather than static groups.
- Continuously audit ABAC policies to ensure compliance with
  multinational operational and legal requirements.

### Sovereign AI

AI capabilities enhance mission collaboration with summarization,
translation, semantic search, and decision support. Sovereign AI ensures
these capabilities remain fully under organizational control, without
reliance on public cloud services or external data processing. Deploying
AI in a self-hosted or compliance-approved environment enables secure,
mission-ready augmentation.

- Deploy
  `OpenAI compatible language models </administration-guide/configure/agents-admin-guide>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} on local or private cloud infrastructure to maintain data
  sovereignty and ensure offline availability.
- Configure
  `custom agents <administration-guide/configure/agents-admin-guide:agent configuration>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} for summarization, workflow automation, and decision
  support while enforcing organizational compliance policies.
- Enable multilingual collaboration in shared channels using sovereign
  AI services to provide [real-time
  translations](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-channel-translations)
  across partner organizations.
- Embed AI into operational playbooks for automated task execution,
  situational summaries, and proactive recommendations.
- Allow authorized users from partner organizations to securely access
  locally hosted LLMs through shared channels in
  `connected workspaces </administration-guide/onboard/connected-workspaces>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}.

### High availability and fault tolerance

Deploy Mattermost in a
`cluster-based architecture </administration-guide/scale/high-availability-cluster-based-deployment>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} to ensure continued availability during outages or hardware
failures. High availability requires redundant infrastructure across
each critical component:

- Application servers: Scale horizontally across multiple nodes with a
  load balancer distributing client traffic.
- Search service:
  `Elasticsearch or AWS OpenSearch Service <administration-guide/scale/scaling-for-enterprise:enterprise search>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} provides optimized search performance with dedicated
  indexing for large-scale deployments.
- Object storage: Configure S3-compatible backends with erasure coding
  or replication for durability. All application servers must access
  shared file storage (NAS or S3) to ensure consistent data
  availability.
- Calls services: Run multiple `rtcd` and offloader nodes for
  resilience.

### Sovereign audio & screensharing

Deploy
`Mattermost Calls </administration-guide/configure/calls-deployment>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} in a self-hosted configuration to ensure voice and screen
sharing capabilities remain operational without reliance on the
internet, and that media traffic does not traverse non-compliant
third-party services.

- The
  `rtcd service <administration-guide/configure/calls-deployment:the rtcd service>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} for scalable, low-latency media routing hosted
  on-premises. Run multiple `rtcd` nodes for redundancy.
- The
  `calls offloader <administration-guide/configure/calls-deployment:configure recording, transcriptions, and live captions>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} service offloads heavy processing tasks like recording,
  transcription and live captioning to a compliance-approved job server.

### Compliance and retention

Sovereign environments often require strict enforcement of retention
policies, legal hold, and export controls. Configure Mattermost\'s
built-in compliance features to meet organizational mandates.

- Enable
  `compliance export </administration-guide/comply/compliance-export>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} and
  `monitoring </administration-guide/comply/compliance-monitoring>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} to produce auditable exports of message data and user
  activity logs.
- Configure
  `message retention </administration-guide/comply/data-retention-policy>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} and
  `legal hold </administration-guide/comply/legal-hold>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} policies to align with applicable regulations.
- Integrate with your organization\'s
  `eDiscovery </administration-guide/comply/electronic-discovery>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} and archiving systems as required.

### Mobile notifications

To prevent sensitive message content from being transmitted to external
notification services such as Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) and
Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), configure Mattermost to use
`ID-only push notifications </deployment-guide/mobile/host-your-own-push-proxy-service>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. In this mode, only a message identifier is sent to public
push notification services, and the client retrieves the content
securely from the Mattermost server over an encrypted channel.
