## Download

Download and install the Mattermost desktop app from the [App Store
(macOS)](https://www.apple.com/app-store/), [Microsoft Store
(Windows)](https://apps.microsoft.com/home?hl=en-US&gl=US), or by
`using a package manager (Linux) </deployment-guide/desktop/linux-desktop-install>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. We strongly recommend installing the desktop app on a local
drive. Network shares aren\'t supported.

In Matermost, users are notified under **Downloads** when new desktop
app releases become available. If managing the distribution of the
mobile app on behalf of users, you can recommend that your users disable
desktop update notifications by going to **... \> File \> Settings** on
Windows or **Mattermost \> Settings** on Mac and clearing the
**Automatically check for updates** option.

See additional deployment options below to manage distribution of the
mobile app to your users.
