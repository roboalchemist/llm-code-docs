# Zero Trust with Mattermost

Mattermost helps organizations adopt and implement Zero Trust principles
to safeguard their mission-critical communications and collaboration.

For security teams, Mattermost's zero-trust-first approach ensures
consistent compliance with organizational risk policies by automating
key governance processes like incident response or data lifecycle
management.

Unlike traditional security approaches, Zero Trust assumes every user
and system may be a potential threat. Mattermost implements this
paradigm by offering customizable, secure solutions that protect
sensitive communication workflows from both internal and external risks.

This document outlines how Mattermost supports the core tenets of Zero
Trust, for organizations of different sizes, including [Identity and
access management](#identity-and-access-management), [Continuous
monitoring](#continuous-monitoring), [Deployment and host
control](#deployment-and-host-control), [Encryption](#encryption),
[Micro-segmentation](#micro-segmentation), [Multi-factor
authentication](#multi-factor-authentication-mfa), [Data
management](#data-management), and [Incident
response](#incident-response). Links to detailed documentation resources
are provided below.

## Identity and access management

Mattermost integrates seamlessly with enterprise identity providers
(IdPs), enabling strong identity verification and strict access control.

By using one of the secure identity mechanisms listed below and
enforcing least-privilege access via roles and groups, Mattermost
ensures that only verified individuals gain access to the platform and
its resources:

- `SAML </administration-guide/onboard/sso-saml>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}: Enables seamless Single Sign-On, ensuring centralized
  authentication to continuously enforce user verification.
- `LDAP </administration-guide/onboard/ad-ldap>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}: Facilitates integration with enterprise directories to
  tightly control user access, adhering to granular identity
  verification.
- `OpenID Connect <administration-guide/configure/authentication-configuration-settings:openid connect>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: Provides secure, standards-based user authentication to
  verify identities and enforce secure access.
- `Session Management <administration-guide/configure/environment-configuration-settings:session lengths>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: Strengthens continuous authentication by controlling
  session lengths and automatically revoking sessions based on
  inactivity or policy violations, ensuring constant identity
  verification. By limiting session lifetimes and enforcing strict
  session policies, Mattermost mitigates the risk of stolen session
  tokens or extended unauthorized access.

Authorized users can seamlessly be added and removed from channels
utilizing the native AD/LDAP integration based on group memberships:

micro-segmentation through its organizational and role-based
capabilities. Micro-segmentation enables organizations to restrict
access to sensitive conversations, ensuring secure communication
channels tailored to individual teams or missions.

To achieve comprehensive micro-segmentation, the following areas of
Mattermost functionality play a critical role.

### Access control and permissions

Ensure precise and role-based access to sensitive resources in order to
minimize the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches:

- `Advanced Access Controls <administration-guide/manage/team-channel-members:advanced access controls>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: Enforces specific permissions configurations to restrict
  access based on roles.
- `Playbook-Specific Permissions </end-user-guide/workflow-automation/share-and-collaborate>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}: Controls access to sensitive workflows, ensuring
  resources are available only to authorized team members.

### Organizational design and user management

Establish a structured and scalable framework for managing user
identities, roles, and access workflows to ensure accountability,
facilitate collaboration, and enforce security policies:

- `Teams </end-user-guide/collaborate/organize-using-teams>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}: Enables segmentation of access and collaboration,
  fostering compartmentalization and limiting exposure to unauthorized
  users.
- `Private Channels <end-user-guide/collaborate/channel-types:private channels>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: Restricts conversations to authorized participants,
  protecting sensitive data and adhering to need-to-know principles.

  role="doc"}: Ensures operational security by enabling controlled
  management access based on responsibilities.
- `Custom Terms of Service </administration-guide/comply/custom-terms-of-service>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}: Requires users to acknowledge organization-specific Terms
  of Service before access ensures alignment with security policies and
  strengthens compliance, particularly in regulated industries where
  custom terms may reflect specific mandates.
- `Granular Permissions </administration-guide/onboard/delegated-granular-administration>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}: Facilitates precise control over user and system
  permissions, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
- `Read-Only Permissions for Files <administration-guide/configure/site-configuration-settings:file sharing and downloads>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}: Limits file-sharing capabilities to safeguard sensitive
  information from unauthorized alterations.

  Enables secure API access with identity verification aligned to least
  privilege.

## Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

Mattermost supports MFA to strengthen authentication practices by adding
an extra layer of protection for high-risk workflows beyond passwords:

- `MFA </administration-guide/onboard/multi-factor-authentication>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}: Enhances user identity verification by requiring multiple
  factors for authentication. MFA ensures that unauthorized users are
  denied access even if passwords are compromised, reducing the risk of
  account breaches.

Alternatively, often enforced through the identity provider (IDP).

## Data management

Data management directly addresses how sensitive information is managed,
controlled, and safeguarded at every stage of the data lifecycle. Proper
data retention practices ensure that data is not only securely stored
but also that it is not retained longer than necessary, thereby reducing
risks.

By retaining data only for the duration that it is needed and then
securely disposing of it, the exposure to malicious activity or
unauthorized access is significantly reduced. Even if attackers gain
access, their exposure is minimized. The less data stored, the smaller
the \"footprint\" for potential exploitation:

- `Data Retention Policies </administration-guide/comply/data-retention-policy>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}: Enforces strict retention controls to reduce data
  exposure and help comply with governance standards.
- `Compliance Export </administration-guide/comply/compliance-export>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}: Ensures data portability for audit and compliance
  purposes in a secure and controlled manner.

  role="doc"}: Boosts organizational oversight by ensuring
  discoverability of stored data for legal and compliance audits under
  secure protocols. E-Discovery capabilities help organizations meet
  compliance expectations for legal audits under frameworks like GDPR or
  HIPAA without sacrificing secure collaboration workflows.
- `Archiving Inactive Teams or Channels <administration-guide/manage/team-channel-members:archive a team>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} &
  `Unarchive Channels </end-user-guide/collaborate/archive-unarchive-channels>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}: Reduces the potential attack surface by securely
  deactivating and storing inactive resources, minimizing both live data
  exposure and the likelihood of exploitation. This approach ensures
  adherence to security best practices while maintaining the ability to
  securely restore resources if needed.

## Incident response

Incident response ensures that organizations can effectively detect,
investigate, and respond to security threats within a framework that
assumes no entity, whether inside or outside the network, should be
trusted by default. Incident response is the operational arm that
ensures that organizations are vigilant, prepared, and capable of
protecting themselves in a dynamic and evolving threat landscape.

Mattermost Playbooks reduce the time to respond to threats and ensure
compliancy-aligned documentation through automated incident
notifications by empowering organizations to predefine and automate
incident response workflows, ensuring that responses are consistent,
documented, and transparent:
