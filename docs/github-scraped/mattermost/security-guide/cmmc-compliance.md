# CMMC Compliance

## Overview

The [Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC)
2.0](https://dodcio.defense.gov/CMMC/) is a U.S. Department of Defense
(DoD) program that requires all contractors, subcontractors, and
suppliers who handle Federal Contract Information (FCI) or Controlled
Unclassified Information (CUI) to achieve certification. Whether your
organization works directly with the DoD or as part of the Defense
Industrial Base (DIB) supply chain, demonstrating compliance is
mandatory to maintain contract eligibility.

Achieving CMMC compliance is not guaranteed as it depends on proper
configuration, policies, and broader organizational practices outside
the software's scope. However, this document outlines how Mattermost's
features can help U.S. Department of Defense contractors and
subcontractors address specific [Level 2
requirements](https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/CMMC/AssessmentGuideL2v2.pdf).

## Access Control and Identity Management

Mattermost supports robust identity and access management to ensure that
only authorized users access the system and that they only see data
permitted for their role. Key capabilities include:

`Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration </administration-guide/onboard/sso-saml>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}: Mattermost integrates with enterprise identity providers
via
`SAML 2.0 </administration-guide/onboard/sso-saml>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"},
`OpenID Connect </administration-guide/onboard/sso-openidconnect>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, and
`AD/LDAP </administration-guide/onboard/ad-ldap>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. This allows you to centrally manage user accounts and
enforce enterprise authentication policies. Only users provisioned in
your directory (and assigned to the Mattermost service) can log in. This
helps satisfy access control requirements to "limit system access to
authorized users" (AC 3.1.1) using vetted corporate identities.

`Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) </administration-guide/onboard/advanced-permissions>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}: Granular permissions in Mattermost ensure users can perform
only the actions permitted for their role. For example, regular users
cannot perform administrative functions, and
`guest accounts </administration-guide/onboard/guest-accounts>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} have restricted access to specific channels. Administrators
can configure
`team-wide <administration-guide/onboard/advanced-permissions:team override scheme>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and
`channel-specific roles/permissions <administration-guide/configure/user-management-configuration-settings:advanced access control>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} so that users only access data and functions needed for
their duties. This supports the principle of least privilege (AC 3.1.5)
and limits users' actions to authorized functions (AC 3.1.2, AC 3.1.7).

`Group-Based Access Management </administration-guide/onboard/ad-ldap-groups-synchronization>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}: Mattermost
`AD/LDAP Group Sync </administration-guide/onboard/ad-ldap-groups-synchronization>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} automates user provisioning and de-provisioning. Users can
be added or removed from Mattermost teams/channels based on their
directory group membership. This ensures timely removal of access when
personnel change roles or leave (addressing account management aspects
of AC 3.1.1) and helps enforce separation of duties (AC 3.1.4) by
aligning channel access with organizational roles.

`Session Management and Timeout <administration-guide/configure/environment-configuration-settings:session lengths>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}: Mattermost administrators can define session security
settings, including session idle timeouts and session lifetime. Sessions
can be automatically invalidated after a period of inactivity or on
demand. By limiting session duration and requiring re-authentication,
Mattermost reduces the risk of unauthorized access via unattended
sessions (helps address AC 3.1.6 for session lock and IA 3.5.2 for
session control). Failed login attempt thresholds can also be set (e.g.
lock out after X failed attempts) to mitigate brute-force attacks,
aligning with AC 3.1.8.

**User Agreement and Access Approval**: Mattermost Enterprise supports a
`Custom Terms of Service </administration-guide/comply/custom-terms-of-service>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} banner that users must accept upon first login. This can be
used to remind users of acceptable use policies or consent to
monitoring, indirectly supporting training/awareness requirements and
ensuring users acknowledge security terms before accessing CUI.

## Authentication and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Secure authentication is critical for protecting Controlled Unclassified
Information (CUI). Mattermost offers several features to strengthen user
authentication in alignment with CMMC requirements:

**Unique User Identification**: Each Mattermost user has a unique
account (username/email), satisfying the need for unique IDs (IA 3.5.1).
Administrators can
`deactivate accounts <administration-guide/configure/user-management-configuration-settings:deactivate users>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} that are found to be generic or shared, and when integrated
with enterprise SSO or LDAP, organizational policies can prevent shared
account use.

**Password Policy Enforcement**: For built-in authentication, Mattermost
administrators can
`enforce strong password requirements <administration-guide/configure/authentication-configuration-settings:password>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} (minimum length, complexity). This helps meet IA 3.5.2 by
requiring robust passwords and reducing the risk of credential
compromise.

`Multi-Factor Authentication </administration-guide/onboard/multi-factor-authentication>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}: Mattermost supports MFA for all user accounts. In
self-hosted deployments, admins can enable and enforce TOTP-based MFA
(e.g. requiring a one-time code from Google Authenticator during login).
When Mattermost is integrated with SSO (SAML/OIDC), you can leverage the
IdP's MFA policies (e.g. CAC/PIV or OTP) for Mattermost logins.
Requiring two factors for authentication aligns with CMMC practice IA
3.5.3, adding an extra layer of verification to protect accounts even if
passwords are compromised.

**Account Lockout and Recovery**: Mattermost can limit failed login
attempts and lock accounts after a specified number of failures, helping
to thwart brute-force attacks (IA 3.5.3, additional aspect). It also
provides options for
`secure password reset <end-user-guide/access/access-your-workspace:reset your password>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} or
`administrator-issued password resets <administration-guide/configure/user-management-configuration-settings:reset user's password>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to support account recovery while maintaining security
controls.

## Audit Logging and Accountability

CMMC Level 2 (NIST 800-171) places heavy emphasis on audit logging and
the ability to track and monitor system activity (Audit &
Accountability, AU 3.3.x controls). Mattermost provides built-in logging
and monitoring features that help meet these requirements:

**System and Application Audit Logs**: Mattermost records server and
application events in an
`audit log <administration-guide/manage/logging:audit logging>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}
(`JSON format </administration-guide/comply/embedded-json-audit-log-schema>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}). This includes security-relevant events such as logins,
account creations, permission changes, server configuration changes, and
more. Enterprise editions can send logs to external
`syslog or monitoring systems <administration-guide/manage/logging:syslog target configuration options>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} in real time. These logs provide the evidence needed for
AU.3.3.1 ("generate audit records for user/activity") and support
analysis of incidents.

**Message History Retention**: By default, Mattermost retains a complete
history of all messages (including edits and deletions) and file uploads
in the database. Even if a user deletes a message in the application,
the data is still preserved in the backend (unless a retention policy is
in place). This ensures actions are traceable to individuals (AU 3.3.2)
and meets requirements to retain and archive audit data. Administrators
can also
`disable users’ ability to edit or delete messages <administration-guide/onboard/advanced-permissions:system scheme>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, guaranteeing an unalterable record of conversation content
for compliance purposes (useful for investigations and meeting audit
retention requirements).

`Compliance Export </administration-guide/comply/compliance-export>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} and
`Electronic Discovery </administration-guide/comply/electronic-discovery>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}: Mattermost's
`Compliance Export </administration-guide/comply/compliance-export>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} feature can automatically export message history and
metadata on a scheduled basis. This helps organizations produce chat
records for audits, e-discovery, or long-term archival outside the
application (relevant to AU 3.3.3 on audit record retention and review).
Additionally, integration with third-party archiving and e-discovery
tools is supported (e.g. Smarsh/Global Relay), enabling centralized
analysis of communications for compliance.

**Automated Monitoring and Alerts**: Administrators can generate daily
compliance reports of Mattermost activity or use the audit data for
anomaly detection. Mattermost supports integration with Security
Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems by sending logs to a
`syslog <administration-guide/manage/logging:syslog target configuration options>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} or via the
[API](https://developers.mattermost.com/api-documentation/). This allows
organizations to correlate Mattermost events with other security data
and receive alerts on suspicious behavior (e.g. multiple failed logins,
unexpected user account changes), supporting AU 3.3.4 and RA 3.11.2
(continuous monitoring and risk assessment). Mattermost's audit log can
thus feed into your incident monitoring process for rapid detection of
issues.

**Protection of Audit Information**: Access to Mattermost logs is
restricted to system administrators -- regular users cannot view or
tamper with audit records. Logs written to files on the server can be
further protected by OS-level access controls. This aligns with AU 3.3.5
(prevent unauthorized access/modification of audit records).
Additionally, if using Mattermost Cloud or an external log aggregator,
you should apply appropriate controls to those environments to safeguard
the logs.

## Incident Response and Incident Collaboration

Under CMMC Level 2, companies must establish and maintain an effective
Incident Response (IR) capability (IR 3.6.1--3.6.3). Mattermost is a
valuable tool for incident response planning, execution, and
documentation:

`Incident Playbooks </end-user-guide/workflow-automation/learn-about-playbooks>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}: Collaborative workflows managed through Mattermost
Playbooks allow teams to codify their incident response plans and
checklists directly in the platform. For example, you can create a
playbook for "Cyber Incident Response" that automatically spins up a
dedicated incident channel, assigns tasks to responders, notifies
stakeholders, and tracks investigation steps when an incident is
declared. This ensures a standardized response process, fulfilling the
requirement to establish an operational incident-handling capability (IR
3.6.1) with defined preparation, detection, containment, and recovery
steps.

**Dedicated Incident Channels**: Mattermost enables the creation of
`private, invite-only channels <end-user-guide/collaborate/channel-types:private channels>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for incident responders. During an incident (e.g. a network
breach or system outage), teams can coordinate in a secure Mattermost
channel that is isolated from potentially compromised systems.
Mattermost's self-hosted or air-gapped deployment options allow it to
serve as an
`out-of-band communication </deployment-guide/reference-architecture/deployment-scenarios/deploy-oob>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}) platform if primary systems or networks are affected. This
approach helps contain incidents by preventing adversaries from
monitoring or disrupting incident comms, and supports IR 3.6.1's
requirement for effective coordination during an incident.

**Real-Time Notifications and Integrations**: Mattermost can integrate
with monitoring tools and security systems to streamline detection and
response. For instance, a SIEM or IDS can post an alert to a Mattermost
channel (via webhooks or integrations) to notify the team of a potential
incident. Mattermost
`Playbooks </end-user-guide/workflow-automation/learn-about-playbooks>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} support
`automated incident notifications </end-user-guide/workflow-automation/notifications-and-updates>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} -- triggering alerts to responders when certain conditions
are met. This real-time alerting and centralization of incident
communication assists with prompt detection and reporting of incidents
(IR 3.6.2). Team members can discuss and analyze the threat in
Mattermost, accelerating triage.

**Task Tracking and Documentation**: With Mattermost
`Playbooks </end-user-guide/workflow-automation/learn-about-playbooks>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} and
`Boards </end-user-guide/project-management/work-with-boards>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, each incident response run can have an associated
`checklist of tasks </end-user-guide/workflow-automation/work-with-tasks>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} (e.g. Identify affected systems, Collect logs, Eradicate
malware, etc.) and an owner for each task. Responders check off tasks as
they are completed, and all actions are timestamped. This creates an
auditable timeline of the incident. All discussion in the incident
channel, file attachments (like forensic screenshots), and timeline of
actions are preserved. This comprehensive documentation of incidents
satisfies IR 3.6.2's mandate to track and report incidents to
appropriate officials, and helps during post-incident analysis.
Mattermost also facilitates post-incident reviews by enabling teams to
add
`retrospective notes <end-user-guide/workflow-automation/metrics-and-goals:configure retrospectives before a run>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} in the channel or Playbook run after resolution. These
records can be exported as needed for reporting to DoD or other
authorities.

**Testing Incident Response**: Mattermost can be used to conduct
incident response drills or tabletops. Teams can simulate incidents by
`running playbooks </end-user-guide/workflow-automation/work-with-runs>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} in Mattermost (e.g. a planned exercise) to verify that
everyone receives notifications and follows the procedures. This helps
meet IR 3.6.3 (test the incident response capability) by providing a
platform to perform and document response tests. Over time, playbook
analytics and metrics (e.g. average time to resolution) allow you to
gauge improvements in IR performance.

By leveraging Mattermost for incident response, organizations create a
central hub for managing incidents from initial alert to post-mortem.
This directly supports CMMC Level 2 requirements to have an established,
tested incident response process and to document and report incidents in
a timely manner.

## Communications Protection and Data Security

CMMC Level 2 includes controls to safeguard information during storage
and transmission (System & Communications Protection, SC 3.13.x) and to
limit unauthorized information flows. Mattermost offers multiple
features to protect data and control communications:

`Encryption in Transit </deployment-guide/transport-encryption>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}: All Mattermost client-server communication can be
`encrypted </deployment-guide/encryption-options>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} using TLS (Transport Layer Security). When configured with
HTTPS, Mattermost encrypts data in transit between the server and
clients (web, desktop, mobile), preventing eavesdropping on CUI being
discussed or transferred. This meets the requirement to protect CUI on
networks by encrypting it during transmission (SC 3.13.8). Mattermost
supports modern TLS protocols and ciphers; administrators should
configure TLS per DoD guidelines (e.g. FIPS 140-2 validated
cryptographic modules where applicable) to fully satisfy this control.

`Encryption at Rest <deployment-guide/encryption-options:encryption-at-rest>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}: Mattermost supports encryption of data at rest through
enterprise database and storage configurations. The application can be
deployed on encrypted file systems or use encrypted storage backends.
For instance, if using Amazon S3 for file storage, Mattermost Enterprise
can enable
`server-side encryption with S3-managed keys <administration-guide/configure/environment-configuration-settings:enable server-side encryption for amazon s3>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. If using a self-hosted database, administrators can enable
disk encryption or TDE on the database server. By encrypting the
Mattermost database and storage drives, organizations add a layer of
protection for CUI stored in chat messages and files, helping to meet SC
3.13.16 (protect confidentiality of CUI at rest) and MP 3.8.3 (media
sanitization if disks are disposed). Mattermost documentation encourages
regular key rotation and secure key management for encryption at rest.

**Network Access Control and Segmentation**: Mattermost can be deployed
in a manner that controls network access to the system. In self-hosted
deployments, organizations often place Mattermost servers in a secure
enclave or DMZ with firewalls controlling ingress/egress. For cloud
deployments, Mattermost Cloud offers
`IP allowlisting </administration-guide/manage/cloud-ip-filtering>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} (Enterprise plan) to restrict access to known IP ranges.
These configurations address SC 3.13.1 and SC 3.13.2 by allowing
Mattermost to reside within a protected network segment and ensuring
only trusted networks or VPN users can reach it. Additionally, within
Mattermost, data is segmented by
`Teams </end-user-guide/collaborate/organize-using-teams>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} and
`Channels </end-user-guide/collaborate/channel-types>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} -- you can create separate teams for different projects or
clearance levels, and mark channels as private to restrict membership.
This "micro-segmentation" of conversations ensures that sensitive
discussions (e.g. about a specific CUI program) are isolated to
authorized individuals, reducing inadvertent information exposure.

`Self-Hosted <deployment-guide/server/server-deployment-planning:deployment options>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and
`Air-Gapped Deployment </deployment-guide/deployment-guide-index>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}: Unlike many collaboration tools, Mattermost can be fully
self-hosted on-premises or in a sovereign cloud, giving organizations
complete control over data locality. DoD contractors can
`deploy Mattermost in an air-gapped environment </deployment-guide/reference-architecture/deployment-scenarios/air-gapped-deployment>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} with no outside internet connectivity if required. This
supports compliance when handling CUI that cannot be exposed to external
systems. By keeping Mattermost within the same secured IT boundary as
other CUI systems, contractors address concerns of SC 3.13.5 (isolate
system components from external access). Mattermost's deployment
flexibility (on-prem, GovCloud, etc.) allows alignment with DoD
requirements (e.g. hosting at IL4/IL5 for sensitive data, if using cloud
infrastructure). All user data resides in the infrastructure you
control, aiding data sovereignty and compliance with any
[FedRAMP](https://www.fedramp.gov/) or
[ITAR](https://www.pmddtc.state.gov/ddtc_public/ddtc_public?id=ddtc_public_portal_itar_landing)
restrictions that may apply in addition to CMMC.

**Data Loss Prevention Measures**: While Mattermost does not natively
include a full DLP suite, administrators can enforce certain
restrictions to prevent unauthorized sharing or retention of data. For
example,
`public link sharing <administration-guide/configure/site-configuration-settings:public links>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} (for files) can be disabled or restricted, ensuring that
shared files are not exposed to untrusted users.
`File Upload Settings <administration-guide/configure/site-configuration-settings:file sharing and downloads>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and
`Plugin Whitelisting <administration-guide/configure/plugins-configuration-settings:enable remote marketplace>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} allow you to control what types of files can be shared or
which integrations are allowed, supporting SC 3.13.4 (control of
information flows). Additionally, the
`Push Notification contents <administration-guide/configure/site-configuration-settings:push notification contents>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} can be configured to omit message text, so that if mobile
push notifications are used, they do not leak sensitive message content
to device lock screens or external services. For more advanced DLP,
Mattermost's open
[APIs](https://developers.mattermost.com/api-documentation/) and
[webhooks](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/webhooks/) enable
integration with external DLP solutions or content filtering systems
(e.g. a script could detect and remove messages containing certain
keywords or PII). These measures help fulfill AC 3.1.3 / SC 3.13.4 by
controlling the flow of CUI and preventing it from leaving authorized
channels.

**Sensitive Information Controls**:
`System-wide banners </administration-guide/manage/system-wide-notifications>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} can display CUI handling notices such as \"⚠️ This system
contains CUI. Use authorized accounts only. All activity is monitored.\"
Supports AC.L2-3.1.9, AT.L2-3.2.1, IR.L2-3.6.2, and MP.L2-3.8.2. As well
as
`channel-specific banners </end-user-guide/collaborate/display-channel-banners>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} can be used to flag channels containing CUI or incident
response data, reinforce workflow integrity, or restrict data sharing.
Supports AC.L2-3.1.3, MP.L2-3.8.2, AU.L2-3.3.1/3.3.2, and SC.L2-3.13.4.

**Antivirus Scanning**: To address system integrity requirements (SI
3.14.5 for scanning files for malware), Mattermost can integrate with
antivirus tools. A [ClamAV
plugin](https://mattermost.com/marketplace/antivirus-plugin/) is
available that scans files uploaded to Mattermost for viruses and
malware. When enabled, this helps ensure that malicious files are
detected and quarantined, protecting users and meeting the intent of
controls on detecting and protecting against malware (SI 3.14.4 and SI
3.14.5). Administrators should also keep the Mattermost server host
up-to-date with security patches and monitor for vulnerabilities (SI
3.14.1/3.14.2), as part of overall system integrity maintenance.
