# Dependency Vulnerability Analysis

This document provides context on why certain third-party dependencies
in Mattermost, although flagged as vulnerable by security scanners, do
not pose a risk in Mattermost deployments.

This analysis is regularly updated as new vulnerability reports are
received and evaluated.

## Overview

Mattermost regularly scans its dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
Some dependencies may be flagged as vulnerable by security scanners, but
these vulnerabilities might not be applicable to Mattermost due to:

- How the dependency is used in Mattermost
- The specific version or configuration implemented
- Mitigations already in place
- False positives in the scanning process

## Dependency Analysis Table

Below is a list of dependencies flagged as vulnerable by security
scanners for our latest release, along with the justification for why
each issue is not relevant to Mattermost deployments:

  github.com/mattermost/   Multiple CVE IDs       Mattermost uses Go module
  mattermost/server/v8                            workspaces, which override go.mod
                                                  dependency versions with local
                                                  filesystem code at build time. The
                                                  vulnerable versions are never
                                                  included in final Docker images.
