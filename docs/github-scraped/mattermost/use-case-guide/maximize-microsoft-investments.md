The following mission-ready collaboration capabilities are available:

## Sovereign Communication in Microsoft Teams

Agencies and critical infrastructure organizations must often comply
with strict data sovereignty rules that restrict cloud usage for
sensitive collaboration.

**Benefits**

- **Deploy Mattermost on-premise or in sovereign clouds**, fully
  integrated with Microsoft Teams and Outlook (See
  `Mattermost for M365, Teams, and Outlook </integrations-guide/mattermost-mission-collaboration-for-m365>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}) to maintain workflow continuity and secure data storage.
- **Store messages, recordings, and transcriptions in
  compliance-approved systems**, with
  `data-at-rest encryption <security-guide/security-guide-index:data-at-rest encryption>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} ensuring no leakage of sensitive data to third-party
  platforms.
- **Enable secure Microsoft Teams interactions via embedded Mattermost
  collaboration**, supporting operations within familiar interfaces
  while enforcing regulatory compliance. See
  `Mattermost for M365, Teams, and Outlook </integrations-guide/mattermost-mission-collaboration-for-m365>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}.
- **Enforce agency-specific policies** with
  `legal hold </administration-guide/comply/legal-hold>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"},
  `retention policies </administration-guide/comply/data-retention-policy>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}, and
  `user access controls </administration-guide/onboard/advanced-permissions>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} that align with national or sectoral mandates.

## On-Premises Skype for Business Replacement

As Skype for Business reaches end-of-life, secure organizations require
an alternative that preserves on-premises control, integrates into
Microsoft workflows, and meets the security standards of air-gapped and
classified environments. Cloud-first replacements like Microsoft Teams
are not always viable due to network segmentation, compliance
restrictions, or data sovereignty mandates.

## Out-of-Band Incident Response for Microsoft-Centric Environments

During high-stakes incidents, Microsoft 365 tools can be limited or
unavailable, slowing down response times and jeopardizing mission
continuity.
