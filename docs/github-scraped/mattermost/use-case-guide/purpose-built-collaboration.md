# Purpose-Built Collaboration

From large-scale logistics operations to critical infrastructure
defense, organizations are under pressure to act faster, with fewer
resources and greater operational complexity. But legacy chat platforms
and multi-purpose messaging tools can\'t keep pace with dynamic,
high-stakes workflows. They lack the integration depth, security
controls, and mission-specific configurability needed for real-time
operational success.

Mattermost provides a purpose-built collaboration platform designed for
technical, operational, and industrial teams. It brings people, tools,
and workflows together in a secure, extensible
environment---streamlining coordination, improving decision velocity,
and increasing resilience. Whether coordinating a global logistics
chain, managing operational technology (OT) in the field, or running a
security operations center, Mattermost adapts to your environment---not
the other way around.

The following mission-ready collaboration capabilities are available:

## Global Logistics Coordination

Coordinating logistics across continents, agencies, and time zones
requires a secure, unified platform that centralizes communications and
aligns stakeholders.

**Benefits**

- **Enable real-time coordination** across supply chains, procurement,
  and field units with
  `channel-based messaging </end-user-guide/messaging-collaboration>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} and
  `playbook-driven workflows </end-user-guide/workflow-automation>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} that standardize communication and reduce friction.
- **Connect systems across logistics networks** by integrating ERP,
  fleet tracking, maintenance management, and transportation tools via
  `webhooks, APIs, and plugins </integrations-guide/integrations-guide-index>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}.
- **Preserve operational continuity** during outages or disruptions
  using
  `self-hosted deployments <deployment-guide/server/server-deployment-planning:deployment options>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} and
  `high availability architecture </administration-guide/scale/high-availability-cluster-based-deployment>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} that eliminate reliance on third-party cloud services.
- **Support multilingual coordination** with
  `localized UI options <end-user-guide/preferences/manage-your-display-options:language>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} in 20+ languages to ensure inclusive collaboration across
  global teams.

## Operational Technology and ICS Collaboration

OT and field operations in energy, utilities, manufacturing, and
transportation sectors demand secure, real-time communication across
widely distributed assets and personnel. From remote substations and
industrial facilities to on-site emergency repair teams, teams must
coordinate without exposing sensitive control systems or violating
compliance standards.

Mattermost enables secure collaboration across OT environments and field
operations, even under disconnected, air-gapped, or constrained network
conditions.

**Benefits**

- **Enable compliant, real-time OT communications** across operational
  zones and facilities using
  `secure, on-prem collaboration <deployment-guide/server/server-deployment-planning:deployment options>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} that keeps data within your control perimeter.
- **Support field teams with hardened mobile access** using
  `EMM-based app provisioning </deployment-guide/mobile/deploy-mobile-apps-using-emm-provider>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"},
  `biometric authentication <deployment-guide/mobile/mobile-security-features:biometric authentication>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"},
  `jailbreak detection <deployment-guide/mobile/mobile-security-features:jailbreak and root detection>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}, and
  `ID-only push notifications <administration-guide/configure/environment-configuration-settings:id-only push notifications>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}---ensuring that only authorized, uncompromised devices can
  access operational data.
- **Integrate with industrial monitoring systems** like SCADA, PI
  historians, and plant analytics using
  `alert-driven webhook and plugin integrations </integrations-guide/integrations-guide-index>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} that push system events to relevant mobile or desktop
  channels.
- **Ensure system and network isolation** with
  `air-gapped deployment support </deployment-guide/reference-architecture/deployment-scenarios/air-gapped-deployment>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} that allows full collaboration within OT enclaves and
  disconnected environments.
- **Prevent mobile data leakage** via
  `remote wipe capabilities <security-guide/mobile-security:mobile device management (mdm)>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} and
  `screenshot/screen recording prevention <deployment-guide/mobile/mobile-security-features:screenshot and screen recording prevention>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} for mobile devices used in the field.

## Technical Operational Command Centers

Engineering, infrastructure, and security teams manage increasingly
complex environments. Whether responding to incidents, deploying
software, or monitoring infrastructure, they need customizable
workspaces that reduce cognitive load and integrate the tools they
trust.

**Benefits**

- **Accelerate decision-making and incident response** using
  `Collaborative Playbooks </end-user-guide/workflow-automation>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} to automate workflows for triage, patching, code releases,
  and security alerts.
- **Customize your collaboration environment** with
  `theming </end-user-guide/preferences/customize-your-theme>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"},
  `custom branding </administration-guide/configure/custom-branding-tools>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}, and
  `channel templates </end-user-guide/messaging-collaboration>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} to mirror internal teams and operational domains.
- **Extend platform capabilities** with
  `slash commands, bots, and custom plugins </integrations-guide/integrations-guide-index>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} that connect Mattermost to CI/CD systems, alerting
  frameworks, ticketing platforms, and internal tools.
- **Increase usability and team cohesion** with
  `custom emojis <end-user-guide/collaborate/react-with-emojis-gifs:upload custom emojis>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}, shared terminology, and
  `real-time messaging </end-user-guide/messaging-collaboration>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} optimized for platform engineers, DevSecOps teams, and
  field service managers.
