# Real-Time DevSecOps Collaboration

Modern mission-driven software teams---ranging from critical
infrastructure operators to government software factories---face the
challenge of delivering and defending complex systems at speed. From
CI/CD pipelines to incident response, secure collaboration is essential
to ensure resilience, compliance, and operational success in
environments where failure is not an option.

Traditional messaging platforms, designed for commercial office
settings, often introduce friction, fragmentation, and risk into
DevSecOps workflows. These multi-purpose tools are optimized for generic
team chat or water-cooler conversation---not for secure, structured
collaboration in high-stakes delivery environments. As a result,
critical signals get lost in noisy channels, response times slow down,
and sensitive workflows are exposed to tools that lack operational
control.

Mattermost provides a secure, real-time ChatOps platform designed for
DevSecOps collaboration in high-assurance environments. Whether
supporting sovereign software supply chains, regulated platforms, or
air-gapped operational environments, Mattermost unifies delivery,
security, and platform teams into a single, extensible system built for
mission velocity and compliance.

The following mission-ready DevSecOps capabilities are available:

## Continuous Integration & Delivery (CI/CD) Coordination

Coordinating secure software delivery requires tight integration between
code commits, testing pipelines, release workflows, and stakeholder
approval.

**Benefits**

- **Automate pipeline visibility and alerting** by integrating with
  CI/CD tools like GitLab, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions using the
  `Mattermost integrations platform </integrations-guide/integrations-guide-index>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}.
- **Coordinate secure releases and hotfixes** using
  `Collaborative Playbooks </end-user-guide/workflow-automation>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} to manage rollout steps, validation gates, and team
  notifications.
- **Enable traceable delivery communications** through
  `channel-based collaboration </end-user-guide/messaging-collaboration>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}, ensuring build logs, changelogs, and approvals remain
  accessible and audit-ready.
- **Support deployments in regulated and sovereign environments** using
  `self-hosted Kubernetes deployment models </deployment-guide/server/deploy-kubernetes>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} for full control over CI/CD communications.

## Platform Engineering & Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)

Platform teams need streamlined, secure ways to deliver services and
enable developers while maintaining governance and uptime.

**Benefits**

- **Centralize platform requests and updates** in
  `dedicated channels </end-user-guide/messaging-collaboration>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} that organize provisioning, support, and environment
  status discussions.
- **Automate ticket triage and escalation workflows** using
  `Playbooks </end-user-guide/workflow-automation>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} to track response SLAs and ownership across platform
  operations.
- **Monitor infrastructure health and changes** with integrated feeds
  from
  `Prometheus, Grafana </administration-guide/scale/deploy-prometheus-grafana-for-performance-monitoring>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}, or custom observability tools---supporting faster
  feedback loops.
- **Support hybrid cloud and edge operations** through
  `deployment flexibility <deployment-guide/server/server-deployment-planning:deployment options>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} across public, private, and disconnected environments.

## Secure Incident Response for Production Systems

Real-time visibility and structured collaboration are critical during
service degradations, outages, or suspected intrusions.

**Benefits**

- **Automate incident handling** with
  `Playbooks </end-user-guide/workflow-automation>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} to track diagnostics, assign tasks, and issue
  updates---supporting NOC, SRE, and AppSec workflows.
- **Accelerate containment and recovery** by
  `integrating alerting tools <integrations-guide/integrations-guide-index:webhooks>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} like PagerDuty, Opsgenie, and custom webhooks into secure
  Mattermost channels.
- **Ensure communication continuity** during outages using
  `high availability architecture </administration-guide/scale/high-availability-cluster-based-deployment>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} and
  `support for disconnected environments </deployment-guide/reference-architecture/deployment-scenarios/air-gapped-deployment>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}.
- **Enable forensic review and audit** with
  `logging and export capabilities <administration-guide/manage/logging:audit logging>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} that preserve all incident-related communications.

## Policy-Driven Collaboration in Regulated Environments

Critical infrastructure DevSecOps must align with strict security,
audit, and compliance requirements---including supply chain controls and
Zero Trust architecture.

**Benefits**

- **Apply granular role-based access controls** using
  `advanced permissions </administration-guide/onboard/advanced-permissions>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} and
  `channel-specific configurations <administration-guide/manage/team-channel-members:advanced access controls>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} to protect sensitive workflows.
- **Support supply chain security coordination** by using
  `Playbooks </end-user-guide/workflow-automation>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} to manage SBOM reviews, vendor risk analysis, and software
  intake workflows across internal and external teams.
- **Enforce secure collaboration behavior** through
  `custom Terms of Service </administration-guide/comply/custom-terms-of-service>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"},
  `data retention policies </administration-guide/comply/data-retention-policy>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}, and user authentication tied to
  `SSO and Entra ID </administration-guide/onboard/sso-entraid>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}.
- **Deploy in line** with
  `Zero Trust </security-guide/zero-trust>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} principles with
  `self-managed, segmented deployments <deployment-guide/server/server-deployment-planning:deployment options>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} that enforce identity, access, and policy
  boundaries---suitable for classified or sovereign cloud environments.
