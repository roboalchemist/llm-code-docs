# Integrated Security Operations

**Fragmented security operations create the blind spots attackers
exploit. Deploy unified collaboration that coordinates your entire
security ecosystem in real-time.**

In today\'s evolving threat landscape, fragmented workflows, isolated
teams, and disjointed tools create delays and blind spots in
organizational defense. As threats scale across geopolitical, cyber, and
supply chain domains, security operations must become more
integrated,unifying monitoring, simulation, response, and intelligence
into a continuous, coordinated system.

Mattermost provides a secure, extensible platform for integrated
security operations,built to support real-time coordination,
mission-specific tooling, and sensitive communications. Whether deployed
as a self-hosted Kubernetes instance, Linux server in your local data
center, or in sovereign hosting environments, Mattermost empowers
security teams to accelerate detection, decision-making, and coordinated
response while maintaining full operational control. Built for
security-conscious teams across commercial, government, and regulated
industries, Mattermost supports integrated incident workflows and
enterprise-level access control.

Mattermost supports security workflows across:

## Security Operations Centers (SOCs)

SOCs are the front lines of real-time monitoring, triage, and
escalation. Coordinating across analysts, tools, and environments
requires fast, structured communication and secure data handling.

**Benefits**

- **Accelerate triage and response workflows** with
  `Collaborative Playbooks </end-user-guide/workflow-automation>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} that automate escalations, task assignment, and ticket
  updates for consistent response execution.
- **Integrate detection pipelines and observability tools** using the
  `Mattermost integrations platform </integrations-guide/integrations-guide-index>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} to surface alerts from SIEM, SOAR, and log analysis
  systems into dedicated response channels.
- **Maintain operational security and compliance** through
  `role-based permissions </administration-guide/onboard/advanced-permissions>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} and
  `audit logging <administration-guide/manage/logging:audit logging>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} to safeguard sensitive incident data.
- **Operate in secure, classified, or hybrid environments** using
  Kubernetes or Linux on the infrastructure of your choice: Public
  cloud, organization data center, or fully air-gapped.
  `Explore deployment options <deployment-guide/server/server-deployment-planning:deployment options>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.
- **Meet regulatory compliance requirements** with a solution that
  adapts to your organization\'s security posture and regulatory
  requirements, incl. GDPR, FedRAMP, ISO 27001, and more.

## Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs)

CERTs serve as rapid-response teams during high-risk events, requiring
tight coordination, reliable workflows, and cross-unit information flow.

**Benefits**

- **Orchestrate high-stakes incident response** through
  `Collaborative Playbooks </end-user-guide/workflow-automation>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} tailored for malware outbreaks, data exfiltration events,
  and zero-day exploits.
- **Centralize and structure communication** with
  `channel-based collaboration </end-user-guide/messaging-collaboration>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}, including
  `file sharing </end-user-guide/collaborate/share-files-in-messages>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"},
  `threaded updates </end-user-guide/collaborate/organize-conversations>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}, and task-tracking across affected teams.
- **Enable coordination across geographies** using
  `multi-device access </deployment-guide/deployment-guide-index>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} and
  `mobile EMM support </deployment-guide/mobile/deploy-mobile-apps-using-emm-provider>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} for secure participation across locations and devices.
- **Preserve evidentiary and compliance data** through
  `audit logs <administration-guide/manage/logging:audit logging>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} and configurable
  `exports </administration-guide/manage/bulk-export-tool>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} for legal review or forensic handoff.
- **Ensure data sovereignty** with flexible hosting options including
  EU-resident infrastructure, on-premises deployments, and air-gapped
  environments that maintain full control over sensitive communications.

## Federated Threat Intelligence & Information Sharing

Cross-organizational threat intelligence teams,spanning sectors,
regions, and public-private partnerships,require secure, policy-driven
platforms for sharing indicators, coordinating alerts, and supporting
collective defense efforts.

**Benefits**

- **Collaborate securely across agencies or organizations** using
  `Connected Workspaces </administration-guide/onboard/connected-workspaces>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} to synchronize alerts, discussions, and file sharing with
  trusted external partners.
- **Support multinational and sectoral collaboration** with
  `custom terms of service enforcement </administration-guide/comply/custom-terms-of-service>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} and
  `localized UI settings <end-user-guide/preferences/manage-your-display-options:language>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} for global partner access.
- **Preserve operational trust and compliance** through
  `role-based access controls </administration-guide/onboard/advanced-permissions>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} and
  `channel-specific permissions <administration-guide/manage/team-channel-members:advanced access controls>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} that enforce jurisdictional and information-sharing
  agreements.
- **Operationalize shared threat intelligence** by integrating IOCs,
  threat actor profiles, and shared playbooks into your Mattermost
  instance via the
  `integrations platform </integrations-guide/integrations-guide-index>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}.
- **Scale communication globally** with Mattermost\'s
  `high availability and horizontal scalability architecture </administration-guide/scale/scaling-for-enterprise>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"},supporting tens of thousands of users across enterprise,
  field, government, or classified environments.
