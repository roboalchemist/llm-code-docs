# Self-Sovereign Collaboration

As data privacy laws tighten and geopolitical risk escalates,
organizations must rethink how they control and protect communications.
Cloud-centric collaboration platforms often introduce legal exposure,
third-party monitoring, and cross-border compliance conflicts---putting
operations and data at risk. Whether driven by internal policy,
regulatory mandates, or national data sovereignty requirements, more
organizations are moving toward self-sovereign collaboration models.

Mattermost provides a secure, extensible collaboration platform that
delivers full control over data, infrastructure, and compliance posture.
Built on a self-hosted, open core foundation, Mattermost supports
localized deployments across air-gapped, private cloud, and sovereign
environments---ensuring organizations can future-proof operations, meet
global compliance demands, and maintain continuous operational
continuity without third-party dependencies.

The following mission-ready sovereign collaboration capabilities are
available:

## Localized Compliance and Data Control

Managing global operations means adhering to regional
regulations---without compromising productivity or communication
security.

**Benefits**

- **Meet global compliance mandates** like GDPR and data localization
  laws by deploying Mattermost in
  `public, private, or sovereign cloud environments </product-overview/cloud-subscriptions>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} tailored to national regulatory frameworks.
- **Ensure full data control and transparency** with
  `self-hosted deployment options <deployment-guide/server/server-deployment-planning:deployment options>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} that eliminate exposure to vendor-controlled
  infrastructure or telemetry.
- **Audit and enforce compliance behavior** with
  `role-based access controls <administration-guide/manage/team-channel-members:advanced access controls>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"},
  `custom Terms of Service </administration-guide/comply/custom-terms-of-service>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}, and
  `audit logging <administration-guide/manage/logging:audit logging>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} to align with internal and regulatory standards.
- **Protect identity and access** using
  `SSO integrations </administration-guide/onboard/sso-entraid>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"},
  `AD/LDAP synchronization </administration-guide/onboard/ad-ldap-groups-synchronization>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}, and
  `MFA enforcement </administration-guide/onboard/multi-factor-authentication>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} for secure authentication across geographies and
  operational roles.

## Secure, Sovereign Deployment at Any Scale

From national critical infrastructure to defense-grade networks,
Mattermost offers flexible deployment models that preserve sovereignty
and continuity.

**Benefits**

- **Deploy in classified, air-gapped, or disconnected environments**
  using
  `Kubernetes-based deployments </deployment-guide/server/deploy-kubernetes>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} and STIG-hardened container images to support classified
  operations and sensitive data workflows.
- **Eliminate third-party monitoring** with full control over
  infrastructure, encryption keys, access policies, and system-level
  logging.
- **Scale to meet operational growth** with
  `horizontal scalability architecture </administration-guide/scale/scaling-for-enterprise>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} that supports tens of thousands of users in sovereign
  environments without degrading performance or control.
- **Maintain operational continuity under cyber or supply chain
  disruption** using fully self-managed infrastructure that ensures
  collaboration continues even during cloud outages or external service
  failures.

## Interoperable Mission-Partner Collaboration

Cross-agency, multinational, or coalition collaboration requires
sovereignty without isolation---supporting joint operations while
preserving organizational boundaries.

**Benefits**

- **Create secure shared workspaces** with
  `Connected Workspaces Channels </administration-guide/onboard/connected-workspaces>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} that synchronize discussions, reactions, and file sharing
  across trusted organizations---without exposing internal systems.
- **Control access across organizations** with
  `attribute-based permissions </administration-guide/onboard/advanced-permissions>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} and scoped identity policies to ensure mission alignment
  and sensitive information segmentation.
- **Deploy sovereign AI and workflow automation** in isolated
  environments using
  `air-gapped AI operations </end-user-guide/agents>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} and
  `Collaborative Playbooks </end-user-guide/workflow-automation>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}---enabling intelligence and speed without compromising
  data control.
- **Upgrade legacy platforms** like Skype for Business with modern,
  compliant tools for secure messaging, screen sharing, and team
  coordination.
  `See Skype for Business replacement options </use-case-guide/on-prem-skype-for-business-replacement>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}.

## Unified Collaboration for Secure Workflows

Legacy collaboration tools---such as Skype for Business and other
end-of-life platforms---can no longer meet the demands of modern,
high-assurance environments. These tools often lack support for mobile
security, extensibility, and integration with mission-critical
workflows, creating gaps in continuity, control, and user experience.

Mattermost replaces legacy, on-premises communication systems with a
modern, sovereign collaboration platform built to support today\'s
security, compliance, and operational agility requirements.

**Benefits**

- **Modernize secure messaging and team coordination** with
  `channel-based collaboration </end-user-guide/messaging-collaboration>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"},
  `threaded discussions </end-user-guide/collaborate/organize-conversations>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}, and
  `file sharing </end-user-guide/collaborate/share-files-in-messages>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} that work across web, desktop, and mobile.
- **Replace outdated platforms** like Skype for Business with a
  scalable,
  `self-hosted architecture <deployment-guide/server/server-deployment-planning:deployment options>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} that delivers enhanced user experience, compliance, and
  cross-organizational flexibility.
- **Protect sensitive information on mobile** using
  `enterprise-grade mobile security </security-guide/mobile-security>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} including
  `biometric access <deployment-guide/mobile/mobile-security-features:biometric authentication>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"},
  `jailbreak detection <deployment-guide/mobile/mobile-security-features:jailbreak and root detection>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"},
  `screenshot prevention <deployment-guide/mobile/mobile-security-features:screenshot and screen recording prevention>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}, and remote wipe---ensuring secure access from personal or
  field-issued devices.
- **Extend collaboration capabilities** using
  `integrated workflows and automations </end-user-guide/workflow-automation>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} to replace manual coordination with policy-driven
  processes.
- **Unify teams around a secure, customizable platform** that evolves
  with your mission and integrates with internal systems via
  `webhooks, plugins, and APIs </integrations-guide/integrations-guide-index>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}.
