# Secure Command and Control

Expanding adversarial risk across cyber and kinetic domains requires
faster, more secure, and better-informed coordination across mission
environments. Traditional communication systems often fall short in
high-stakes operational contexts---where minutes matter, information
must remain contained, and decision advantage is critical to mission
success. In an age of contested networks, personal device sprawl, and
fragmented toolsets, organizations need a unified, secure platform to
bridge communication and coordination gaps.

Mattermost provides a secure, extensible Command & Control platform that
accelerates decision advantage through real-time collaboration and
mission-aligned workflows. It enables operational units, contractors,
and mission partners to work together in tightly controlled
environments---whether connected, disconnected, or degraded. With
support for secure mobility, ChatOps, classified deployment models, and
sovereign AI integrations, Mattermost empowers organizations to act
faster, coordinate securely, and maintain operational resilience across
the full mission lifecycle.

  role="doc"} to synchronize discussions, files, and reactions if
  connectivity is restored.

## Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) with Sensitive Information Protections

Modern operations often require users---such as field personnel, mission
partners, or remote contractors---to access critical communication tools
from personal or unmanaged mobile devices. However, this flexibility
introduces new risks when sensitive information or other protected data
is involved. Without strong protections, mobile access becomes a
liability in contested or regulated environments.

Mattermost provides enterprise-grade mobile protections to enable secure
BYOD access without compromising security or compliance. From mobile
application management and encryption enforcement to biometric
authentication and jailbreak detection, Mattermost ensures that data
remains protected, access is governed, and sensitive information stays
within authorized boundaries.

**Benefits**

- **Mitigate unauthorized access** with
  `biometric authentication <deployment-guide/mobile/mobile-security-features:biometric authentication>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} and
  `jailbreak/root detection <deployment-guide/mobile/mobile-security-features:jailbreak and root detection>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}, ensuring only secure and uncompromised devices can access
  mission data.
- **Control information sharing** with
  `screenshot and screen recording prevention <deployment-guide/mobile/mobile-security-features:screenshot and screen recording prevention>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}, blocking unauthorized capture of sensitive content during
  classified or time-sensitive discussions.
