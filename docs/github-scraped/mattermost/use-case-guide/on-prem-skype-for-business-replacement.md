# On-Premises Skype for Business Replacement

With Skype for Business reaching end-of-life, security-conscious
organizations face a critical inflection point. Many operate in
air-gapped or classified environments where cloud-based alternatives are
not viable due to compliance restrictions, risk exposure, or data
sovereignty mandates. Without a secure, modern, on-premises
collaboration platform, these organizations risk operational disruption,
mission misalignment, and non-compliance with stringent regulatory
frameworks.

Mattermost provides a secure, self-hosted communication and
collaboration platform purpose-built for air-gapped environments,
classified networks, and regulated industries. Designed to meet NIST
800-53, FedRAMP, and DISA STIG compliance requirements, Mattermost
replaces legacy tools with modern capabilities---secure messaging, file
sharing, workflow automation, and integrated video collaboration---while
maintaining full enterprise control. Organizations can operate at scale,
enable external collaboration without policy violations, and modernize
their digital workflows without compromising security.

The following mission-ready collaboration capabilities are available:

## Air-Gapped and Classified Operations

Organizations operating in fully disconnected or classified environments
require secure communication platforms that function entirely within
their own infrastructure.

**Benefits**

- **Ensure secure communication in fully disconnected networks** using
  Mattermost\'s support for private on-premise deployments, including
  FIPS 140-3 validated and DISA STIG-hardened container images.

  infrastructure.
- **Maintain operational continuity** with enterprise-grade
  `channel-based collaboration </end-user-guide/messaging-collaboration>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}--- including
  `1:1 audio calls </end-user-guide/collaborate/make-calls>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"},
  `screen sharing <end-user-guide/collaborate/make-calls:share your screen>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"},
  `threaded messaging </end-user-guide/collaborate/organize-conversations>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}, and
  `file sharing </end-user-guide/collaborate/share-files-in-messages>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}---entirely within air-gapped systems.
- **Scale to mission requirements** with a
  `high-availability, horizontally scalable architecture </administration-guide/scale/scaling-for-enterprise>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} that supports tens of thousands of users in secure on-prem
  environments.
- **Preserve data sovereignty and eliminate external dependencies** with
  a self-hosted
  `Kubernetes deployment model </deployment-guide/server/deploy-kubernetes>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} that integrates into classified networks, sovereign data
  centers, or **Azure Local** (formerly Azure Stack HCI) for hybrid
  cloud on-premises scenarios.

## Modernize Secure Collaboration Workflows

Legacy communication tools lack the flexibility, automation, and
usability demanded by modern operational teams. Mattermost introduces
modern collaboration workflows without compromising compliance or
deployment control.

**Benefits**

- **Enable dynamic, cross-platform messaging and coordination** with a
  unified interface across web, desktop, and mobile---featuring
  `threaded discussions </end-user-guide/collaborate/organize-conversations>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"},
  `file previews <end-user-guide/collaborate/share-files-in-messages:preview file attachments>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}, and
  `screen sharing <end-user-guide/collaborate/make-calls:share your screen>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.
- **Streamline mission-critical processes** with
  `Collaborative Playbooks </end-user-guide/workflow-automation>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} that automate and track workflows like incident response,
  shift turnover, and logistics planning.
- **Embed secure video conferencing into daily operations** using the
  [Pexip
  integration](https://mattermost.com/marketplace/pexip-video-connect/),
  allowing real-time video engagement from within your air-gapped or
  secure infrastructure.
- **Support operational task management** through optional Kanban-style
  [Boards](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-boards) for
  structured, accountable planning---hosted securely within your own
  network.
- **Align the user experience with your operational identity** using
  `custom branding </administration-guide/configure/custom-branding-tools>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"},
  `theming </end-user-guide/preferences/customize-your-theme>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}, and
  `product localization <end-user-guide/preferences/manage-your-display-options:language>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} across more than 20 languages to support multinational
  teams.

## Enterprise-Controlled External Collaboration

Collaborating across organizational boundaries must not compromise
compliance or IT governance. Mattermost enables secure external
engagement while keeping control centralized within the enterprise.

**Benefits**

- **Collaborate securely with third parties** via Connected Workspaces
  that allow messaging,
  `file sharing </end-user-guide/collaborate/share-files-in-messages>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}, and
  `thread-based discussions </end-user-guide/collaborate/organize-conversations>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} with external teams---without exposing internal systems.
- **Apply fine-grained access controls and retention policies** to
  external users through enterprise-managed
  `permissions </administration-guide/onboard/advanced-permissions>`{.interpreted-text

  `audit logging <administration-guide/manage/logging:audit logging>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}, and
  `channel-specific configurations <administration-guide/manage/team-channel-members:advanced access controls>`{.interpreted-text
