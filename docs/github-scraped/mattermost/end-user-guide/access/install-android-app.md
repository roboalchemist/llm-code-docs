## Mattermost on Chromebooks

Mattermost Android mobile app for Android isn\'t supported on
Chromebooks. While some Android applications can run on ChromeOS
devices, the Mattermost app isn\'t optimized for this environment and
may not function as expected.

For the best experience on Chromebooks, we recommend accessing
Mattermost through the web app using the Chrome browser. Alternatively,
ChromeOS users can also choose to install the web app as a Progressive
Web App (PWA) directly from the browser for an app-like experience with
a desktop icon and windowed view.
