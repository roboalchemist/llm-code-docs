Mattermost Playbooks provides structure, monitoring and automation for
repeatable, team-based processes integrated with the Mattermost
platform. Playbooks are
`configurable checklists </end-user-guide/workflow-automation/work-with-tasks>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} for teams to achieve
`specific and predictable outcomes </end-user-guide/workflow-automation/metrics-and-goals>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, such as incident response, software release management, and
logistical operations.

From Mattermost v11.1, Entry, Enterprise, and Enterprise Advanced
customers can enable adaptive, conditional workflows responding in real
time to changing mission or operational context. Admins can define
attributes such as severity, category, or linked ticket ID, and use
those attributes to hide or show tasks depending on the values of these
attributes which can be seen and modified during a playbook run. Learn
more about
`playbook attributes <end-user-guide/workflow-automation/work-with-playbooks:playbook attributes>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and
`conditional playbook tasks <end-user-guide/workflow-automation/work-with-tasks:conditional tasks>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

While Playbooks primarily focus on coordinating people and tasks, they
also have integration points. You can trigger a playbook run via an
incoming webhook, allowing an external tool to trigger a playbook run.
Within a playbook, you can define steps that execute webhooks or call
external APIs. Additionally, playbooks can work in conjunction with
plugins, keeping the entire workflow visible in Mattermost, and reducing
the need to switch between apps during critical processes.

:::

Playbooks monitor channels for keywords or user actions to trigger a
structured process, which brings up a set of individual or shared tasks,
each associated with manual or automated actions. As playbooks are
executed, some may have requirements for
`broadcasting status updates to stakeholders </end-user-guide/workflow-automation/notifications-and-updates>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} at regular intervals, to populate workflow dashboards by
conducting
`retrospectives <end-user-guide/workflow-automation/metrics-and-goals:configure retrospectives before a run>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} after the core process is complete, or other customer
requirements as exit criteria for a
`playbook “run” </end-user-guide/workflow-automation/work-with-runs>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

`Advanced permissions </end-user-guide/workflow-automation/share-and-collaborate>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} are also available to delegate and manage playbook controls
in larger organizations.

  edge.

From Mattermost v10.11 and mobile app v2.31.0, mobile users can access
playbooks from the mobile app in read-only mode.
`Playbooks slash commands <end-user-guide/workflow-automation/interact-with-playbooks:slash commands>`{.interpreted-text

interface.
