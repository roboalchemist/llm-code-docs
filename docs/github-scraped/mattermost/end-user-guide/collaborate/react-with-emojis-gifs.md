Emojis and GIFs are small, digital images, animated images, or icons you
can use to communicate or express concepts such as emotions, humor, and
physical gestures in your messages.

From Mattermost v10.10, text emoticons (such as `:)` or `:D`) are
automatically converted to emoji characters in your messages by default.
You can
`disable this auto-rendering <end-user-guide/preferences/manage-your-display-options:render emoticons as emojis>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} if you prefer to keep emoticons as text.

## Quick emoji reactions

You can react with up to 50 emojis per message. Recently used emojis are
sorted based on how often you\'ve used them. Don\'t see your most
recently used emojis? Enable quick reactions by going to **Settings \>
Display** and enabling **Quick reactions on messages**.

## Manage emojis

Using Mattermost in a web browser or the desktop app, you can select
recently used emojis, select a default skin tone for people-based
emojis, as well as manage custom emojis. From Mattermost mobile v2.37.0,
you can select custom emojis and apply custom skin tones on mobile
devices.

### Select default skin tone

Select the **Skin tone** icon in the top right corner of the emoji
picker to specify the skin tone you prefer to use for people-based
emojis by default. You can select an alternate skin tone at any time.

emojis that everyone in your Mattermost

has
`disabled your ability to do so <administration-guide/configure/site-configuration-settings:enable custom emoji>`{.interpreted-text
