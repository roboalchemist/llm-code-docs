Depending on how your system admin has configured Mattermost, you may be
able to
`edit <end-user-guide/collaborate/send-messages:edit messages>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"},
`restore <end-user-guide/collaborate/send-messages:restore a previous version of an edited message>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, and
`delete <end-user-guide/collaborate/send-messages:delete messages>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} messages after you\'ve sent them.

It\'s easy to return to a message in progress with global message
drafts. Find all of your draft messages in the **Drafts** view available
at the top of the channel sidebar. See the
`draft messages <end-user-guide/collaborate/send-messages:draft messages>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} documentation for details.

## Organize discussions into threads

When you reply to messages, those replies are
`organized into a discussion thread </end-user-guide/collaborate/organize-conversations>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. Threaded discussions are easy to follow and allow multiple
parallel conversations to occur at the same time without confusion.

Using Mattermost in a web browser or the desktop app, replies appear
indented slightly in the center pane to indicate that they are child
messages of a parent message. Selecting the reply link opens a sidebar
in the right-hand sidebar in a web browser and the desktop app. To
expand the right-hand sidebar to its full width, select the **Expand**
icon with two arrows at the top of the sidebar.

To shrink the right-hand sidebar to its original width, select the same
**Collapse** icon.
