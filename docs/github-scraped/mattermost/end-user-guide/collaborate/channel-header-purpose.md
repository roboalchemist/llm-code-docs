Every channel in Mattermost serves a purpose and exists for a reason.
You can communicate a channel\'s focus and scope in 3 ways:

- a descriptive [channel name](#channel-name)
- a [channel purpose](#channel-purpose) description
- [channel header](#channel-header) details

## Channel name

You\'re prompted to provide a channel name when
`creating a new channel in Mattermost </end-user-guide/collaborate/create-channels>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. Channel names must be at least 2 characters, and can be up
to 64 characters in length. See the
`channel naming conventions </end-user-guide/collaborate/channel-naming-conventions>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} documentation for additional details and guidance on why
channel naming is important.

Looking to rename an existing channel? See the
`rename channels </end-user-guide/collaborate/rename-channels>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} documentation for details.

## Channel purpose

You\'re prompted to provide an optional channel purpose description when
`creating a channel </end-user-guide/collaborate/create-channels>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} or
`renaming a channel </end-user-guide/collaborate/rename-channels>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. A channel purpose can be up to 250 characters in length,
and is often used to help users decide whether to join that channel.

A channel\'s purpose is visible in the right pane when you select the
**View Info** [\|channel-info\|](##SUBST##|channel-info|) icon for the
channel. Any member of a channel can change a channel\'s purpose
description, unless the system admin has
`disabled the ability to do so </administration-guide/onboard/advanced-permissions>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

## Channel header

A channel header is text that displays directly under a channel name at
the top of the channel. Any channel member can change a channel header,
unless the system admin has
`disabled the ability to do so </administration-guide/onboard/advanced-permissions>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}

A channel header can be up to 1024 characters in length, include
Markdown formatting, and is often used to summarize the channel\'s focus
or to provide links to frequently accessed documents, tools, or
websites.

Web/Desktop

1. Select the channel name at the top of the center pane to access the
    drop-down menu, then select **Channel Settings**.
2. Enter or change channel header details. You can use the same
    `Markdown formatting <end-user-guide/collaborate/format-messages:use markdown>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} in the channel header as you would when composing a
    message.
