From Mattermost v9.1, you can change the members of your group
conversation by converting the group message to a private channel. When
a group message is converted to private, its history and membership are
preserved. Membership in a private channel remains as invitation only.

- Any member of an existing group message, except
  `guests </administration-guide/onboard/guest-accounts>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}, can convert that group message to a private channel.
- Conversation history will be visible to all channel members.
- All group message participants must share at least one team
  membership.
