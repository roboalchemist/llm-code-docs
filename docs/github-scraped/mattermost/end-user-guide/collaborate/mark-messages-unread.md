If you read a message, but don\'t have time to address it right away,
you can mark that message as unread. Marking a message as unread
displays the channel as bold in the channel sidebar, and groups the
message with all other unread messages.

::: tab
Web/Desktop

Hover over the message, select the **More**
[\|more-icon\|](##SUBST##|more-icon|) option, then select **Mark as
Unread**.

![When you hover over messages, you can access more message options from the More icon.](../../images/message-more.png)
