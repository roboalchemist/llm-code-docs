If you read messages in a channel, but don\'t have time to address them
right away, you can mark that channel as unread. Hover over the channel
name in the channel sidebar, select the **More**
[\|more-icon-vertical\|](##SUBST##|more-icon-vertical|) option, then
select **Mark as Unread**.

![When you hover over channels in the channel sidebar, you can access more message options from the More icon.](../../images/channel-more.png)
