Anyone can rename the channels they belong to, unless the system admin
has
`restricted the permissions to do so using advanced permissions </administration-guide/onboard/advanced-permissions>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

::: tab
Web/Desktop

Select the channel name at the top of the center pane to access the
drop-down menu, then select **Channel Settings**. You\'ll be prompted to
provide two pieces of information:

- **Channel name:** The channel name that displays in the Mattermost
  user interface for all users. Enter a different channel name if needed
  or preferred.
- **Channel URL:** The web URL used to access the channel in a web
  browser. Select **Edit** to change the URL, and select **Done** to
  save your changes.

If your system admin has enabled
`channel category sorting <administration-guide/configure/experimental-configuration-settings:enable channel category sorting>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, you can assign the renamed channel to a new or existing
channel category.

For example, a channel could be named `UX Design` and have a URL of
`https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/ux-design`.
