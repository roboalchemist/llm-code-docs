You have two ways to mark a post to make it easy to find later:

- [Saving a message](#save-messages) saves it for only you.
- [Pinning a message](#pin-messages) marks it for an entire channel.

## Save messages

Save messages for later follow up by selecting the **Save**

## Pin messages

All members of a channel can pin important or useful messages to that
channel. The list of pinned messages is visible to all channel members.
There is no limit to the number of pinned posts in a channel. From
Mattermost v10.2, the **Pinned**
[\|pinned-messages\|](##SUBST##|pinned-messages|) icon is hidden when no
messages are pinned.

::: tab
Web/Desktop

1. Hover over the message that you want to pin. The **More**
    [\|more-icon\|](##SUBST##|more-icon|) icon link appears.
2. Select the **More** option, then select **Pin to channel**.

![You can pin messages to make them easy to return to later.](../../images/pin-message-to-channel.png)

Pinned messages are marked with the pinned icon. For example:
