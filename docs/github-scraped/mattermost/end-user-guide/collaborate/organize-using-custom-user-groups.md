Custom groups reduce noise and improve focus by notifying the right
people in a channel at the right time, while maintaining transparency
for all members in that channel. Custom user groups let you notify up to
256 users at a time rather than notifying users individually.

For example, perhaps you want to \@mention a cross-functional team about
a bug fixes needed for an upcoming feature release, without notifying
everyone else in the channel. Using a custom group notifies the
cross-functional team immediately, while keeping important stakeholders
in the loop on the status of the feature release.

Or perhaps you want to add a group of users to a team and a channel.
When you \@mention a custom group in a channel, Mattermost prompts you
to add anyone from that custom group who isn\'t already a channel and
team member. See the
`invite people to your workspace </end-user-guide/collaborate/invite-people>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} documentation for details.

Once a custom user group has been created, you can mention that group
the same way you \@mention another Mattermost member. See the
`mention people in messages </end-user-guide/collaborate/mention-people>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} documentation for details.

- System admins need to enable this feature. See our
  `Mattermost Configuration Settings <administration-guide/configure/site-configuration-settings:enable custom user groups>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} documentation for details.
- From Mattermost v7.2, system admins can limit who can manage custom
  user groups through the Custom Group Manager system admin role. See
  the
  `delegated granular administration </administration-guide/onboard/delegated-granular-administration>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} documentation for details.
- The ability to create custom user groups on mobile will be available
  in a future release. \@mentions for custom user groups on mobile work
  the same as
  `LDAP-synced groups <end-user-guide/collaborate/mention-people:@groupname>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.

## Create a custom group

1. Using Mattermost in a web browser or the desktop app, select
    [\|plus\|](##SUBST##|plus|) at the top of the channel sidebar, then
    select **Create New User Group**.
2. Specify a name and mention. The mention is the handle you use to
    \@mention a notification to the group. Group names must be unique
    across the Mattermost
    `workspace </end-user-guide/end-user-guide-index>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"}. If a name is in use as a channel name, display name, or
    another custom group\'s name, it won\'t be available.
3. Search for and select members to add to the custom user group, then
    select **Create Group**.

## Review group members

From Mattermost v7.8, using Mattermost in a web browser or the desktop
app, select a group mention in a thread to display a list of group
members.

## Manage custom user groups

You can review and filter the list of custom groups, add people to an
existing group, edit the group name or mention, leave the group, or
archive the group.

To manage a custom user group in a web browser or the desktop app,
select **User Groups** from the Products menu, then select the group you
want to modify.
