- Can\'t share invitation links? Contact your Mattermost system admin
  for assistance. An
  `SSL certificate (or a self-signed certificate) </administration-guide/onboard/ssl-client-certificate>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} may be required for link-based invitations to work.
- When inviting guests, you must select at least one channel they can
  access. Guests are limited to the channels you specify and cannot
  discover other channels.
- An invite link can be used by anyone and doesn't change unless it's
  re-generated or revoked by a system admin or team admin via **Team
  Settings \> Access \> Invite Code**.
- Your system admin must
  `enable email invitations <administration-guide/configure/authentication-configuration-settings:enable email invitations>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} and configure
  `email <administration-guide/configure/environment-configuration-settings:smtp>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} for Mattermost to send email-based invitations.
  - Invitation links sent by email expire after 48 hours and can only be
    used once.
- Your system admin can
  `cancel all email invitations <administration-guide/configure/authentication-configuration-settings:invalidate pending email invites>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} that haven\'t yet been accepted within the System Console.
