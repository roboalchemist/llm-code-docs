Threads are a key part of the messaging experience in Mattermost.
They\'re used to organize conversations and enable users to discuss
topics without adding noise to channels or direct messages.

Threaded discussions offers an enhanced experience for users
communicating in threads and replying to messages that includes a
unified threads inbox to read all conversations in one view. Threads
improve the ability to process channel content, find, follow, and resume
conversations more easily, and keep threaded conversations focused.

- From Mattermost v7.0, threaded discussions are enabled by default for
  all new Mattermost deployments. All Mattermost users can create new
  threads, unless the system admin has
  `disabled the ability to do so <administration-guide/configure/site-configuration-settings:threaded discussions>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.
- System admins can
  `configure default availability and user opt-in <administration-guide/configure/site-configuration-settings:threaded discussions>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} of threaded discussions.

## Start or reply to threads

`Replies to messages </end-user-guide/collaborate/reply-to-messages>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} are collapsed under the first message of a thread. Open a
thread by selecting the message or reply count.

From Mattermost v11.2, when using Mattermost in a web browser, you can
open threads in separate browser windows by selecting the **New Window**
[\|new-window-icon\|](##SUBST##|new-window-icon|) icon in the thread
header. This allows you to view and participate in multiple threads
simultaneously without losing context.

## Follow threads and messages

You\'ll automatically follow every thread you participate or are
mentioned in. You can manually follow particular messages and threads so
that any reply activity triggers
`notifications </end-user-guide/preferences/manage-your-notifications>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. Follow or unfollow any thread, at any time. In channels, a
dot next to thread participants means there are unread replies for the
threads you\'re following.

## Known issues

Threaded discussions were released as generally available in Mattermost
v7.0, including significant server performance improvements and more
flexible configuration options for system admins to enable the feature
by default. We highly recommended
`upgrading Mattermost </administration-guide/upgrade/upgrading-mattermost-server>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} to take advantage of configuration and performance
enhancements.
