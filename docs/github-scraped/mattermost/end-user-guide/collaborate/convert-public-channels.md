You must be a system admin or team admin to convert public channels to
private channels. When a channel is converted from public to private,
its history and membership are preserved. Membership in a private
channel remains as invitation only. Publicly-shared files remain
accessible to anyone with the link.

## Convert private channels to public channels

Due to potential security concerns with sharing private channel history,
only system admins can convert private channels to public channels using
the System Console.

- The ability to convert private channels to public channels using the
  [API](https://api.mattermost.com/#tag/channels/operation/UpdateChannelPrivacy)
  or
  `mmctl channel modify command <administration-guide/manage/mmctl-command-line-tool:mmctl channel modify>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} is limited to system admins, team admins, and users with
  specific granular admin roles. Team admins have this permission by
  default, but system admins can restrict it or assign it to other
  roles.
- Granular roles require permissions for managing User Management
  Channels and Groups, including
  `sysconsole_write_user_management_channels` and
  `sysconsole_write_user_management_groups`. Manage permissions through
  the
  `permission scheme <administration-guide/onboard/advanced-permissions:permissions structure>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.
- If
  `Sync Group channel management <administration-guide/manage/team-channel-members:channel management>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} is enabled, private channels can\'t be converted to public
  channels.
::::
