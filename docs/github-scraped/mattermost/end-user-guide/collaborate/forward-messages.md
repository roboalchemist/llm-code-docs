From Mattermost v7.2, using a web browser or the desktop app, you can
forward messages in public channels to other public channels. From
Mattermost v7.5, you can also forward messages from bots and webhooks.

Private channels, direct messages, and group messages intended for
specific people can\'t be forwarded.

To forward a message:

1. Select the **More** [\|more-icon\|](##SUBST##|more-icon|) icon next
    to a message, then select **Forward**.

1. Specify where you want to forward the message, and include an
    optional comment.

Forwarding a message also generates a preview of the message.

Previews respect channel membership permissions, so they're only visible
to users who have access to the original message. If the link is to a
message in a public channel, any member of the team can see the message
preview. If the link is to a message in a private channel or direct
message, only members in that channel can see the message preview.
