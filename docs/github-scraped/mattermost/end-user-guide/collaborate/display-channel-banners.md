From Mattermost v10.9, users with admin permissions can enable channel
banners to remind channel members about being diligent to avoid data
spillage in channels that aren\'t intended for classified or sensitive
information. These non-dismissible banners can be styled using Markdown
and are visible across all Mattermost clients, including web browsers,
the desktop app, and the mobile app.

Channel banner use cases include the following:

- Security classifications, such as **SENSITIVE INFORMATION: IMPACT
  LEVEL 5** with a distinctive color to alert members of the required
  security level.
- Important notices, such as **Reminder: Code complete deadlines are
  Fridays at 3 PM**, for recurring reminders.
- Policy or terms, such as **All discussion in this channel is private
  and restricted** with a red color to signal caution.

    drop-down menu, then select **Channel Settings**.
3. Select **Configuration** and enable the **Channel Banner** option.
4. Specify the banner text you want to display at the top of the
    channel. You can style the text using
    `Markdown <end-user-guide/collaborate/format-messages:use markdown>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}, if desired.
5. Select the banner color.
6. Select **Save** to apply the changes. The banner displays
    immediately.

## Change a channel banner

You can change the banner text or color at any time by following the
same steps above. The new banner text or color displays immediately.

## Remove a channel banner

Disable the **Channel Banner** option in the channel settings to remove
the banner from the channel.
