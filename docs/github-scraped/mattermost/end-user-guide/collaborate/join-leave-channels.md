## Join a channel

Channels are either **public** or **private**.

- **Public** channels are identified with a **Globe**
  [\|globe\|](##SUBST##|globe|) icon. Anyone on the team can join a
  public channel.
- **Private** channels are typically used for sensitive topics, and are
  identified with a **Lock** [\|lock\|](##SUBST##|lock|) icon. You must
  be invited to private channels by another channel member.

When you join channels, depending on the
`channel actions configured </end-user-guide/collaborate/create-channels>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, you may see a welcome message, and channels may be added to
`a category in your channel sidebar </end-user-guide/preferences/customize-your-channel-sidebar>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} automatically. Using Mattermost in a web browser or the
desktop app, access **Channel Actions** from the channel name drop-down
menu in the center pane to see what automatic actions have been
configured.

See the following documentation to learn more about working with
channels:

a channel if you\'re not a member of that channel.
