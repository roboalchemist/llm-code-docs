Channels are where you connect, collaborate, and communicate with your
team about various topics or projects. Use channels to organize
conversations across different topics. as you\'re
`sending messages </end-user-guide/collaborate/send-messages>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"},
`replying to messages </end-user-guide/collaborate/reply-to-messages>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, and
`participating in conversation threads <end-user-guide/collaborate/organize-conversations:start or reply to threads>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

## You\'re added to default channels automatically

Everyone who joins a Mattermost
`workspace </end-user-guide/end-user-guide-index>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} is automatically added to the **Town Square** channel. See
our
`Channel Types </end-user-guide/collaborate/channel-types>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} documentation for details.

## Channel sidebar

In the channel sidebar on the left, you\'ll find all of the the channels
you\'re a member of as well as useful channel management tools. See the
`channel types </end-user-guide/collaborate/channel-types>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} to learn about the types of channels available, how they
work, and how to identify them in the channel sidebar. Learn how to
create channels by visiting the
`create channels </end-user-guide/collaborate/create-channels>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} documentation.

As your channel sidebar fills up with channels you\'ve joined, you can
organize your channels into categories based on how you work. See the
`customize your channel sidebar </end-user-guide/preferences/customize-your-channel-sidebar>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} documentation for details.
