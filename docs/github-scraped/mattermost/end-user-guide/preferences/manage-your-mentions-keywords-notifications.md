You\'re
`notified </end-user-guide/preferences/manage-your-notifications>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} in a
`web browser </end-user-guide/preferences/manage-your-web-notifications>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, the
`desktop app </end-user-guide/preferences/manage-your-desktop-notifications>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, and on your
`mobile device </end-user-guide/preferences/manage-your-mobile-notifications>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, when you\'re \@mentioned by your username or first name,
\@mentioned as part of a user group, and for matches to keywords you\'re
following.

You\'re also notified when someone uses channel-wide
`@mentions </end-user-guide/collaborate/mention-people>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} including
`@channel and @all <end-user-guide/collaborate/mention-people:@channel and @all>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, as well as
`@here <end-user-guide/collaborate/mention-people:@here>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

For all other messages, channels appear bolded to indicate unread
activity.

## Customize notification keywords

Using a web browser or the desktop app, you can customize keywords to
trigger notifications. Keywords aren\'t case-sensitive.

For example, you can receive notifications for all messages and threads
related to a specific topic, project name, or customer.

## Passively track keywords (no notification)

From Mattermost v9.3, Mattermost Enterprise and Professional customers
interested calling attention to specific topics of interest across
channels can do so without sending notifications to a Mattermost client.

Using a web browser or the desktop app, you can passively track key
terms by specifying single or multiple words to be highlighted in all
channels you\'re a member of. Keywords and phrases are automatically
highlighted using a color based on your
`Mattermost theme </end-user-guide/preferences/customize-your-theme>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.
