Select your profile picture and select **Profile** to manage the details
of your Mattermost profile, including your name, username, nickname,
email, and profile picture.

Your Mattermost system admin may
`define custom user profile fields </administration-guide/manage/admin/user-attributes>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} that you can personalize. Additionally, some of your profile
information may be pulled from another source, which means you won\'t be
able to modify it in Mattermost. Contact your Mattermost system admin
for assistance.
