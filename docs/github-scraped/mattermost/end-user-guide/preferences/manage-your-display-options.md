**Compact** mode fits more messages on the screen by decreasing the
spacing around posts, collapsing link previews, and hiding thumbnails so
that only file names are shown. Some formatting types, such as block
quotes and headings, are also reduced in size.

When you select **Compact**, usernames are colorized by default, and
username colors are consistent for all users. Disable the **Colorize
