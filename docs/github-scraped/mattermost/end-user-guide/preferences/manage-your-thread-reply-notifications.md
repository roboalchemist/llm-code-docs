You\'re
`notified </end-user-guide/preferences/manage-your-notifications>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} in a
`web browser </end-user-guide/preferences/manage-your-web-notifications>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, the
`desktop app </end-user-guide/preferences/manage-your-desktop-notifications>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, and on your
`mobile device </end-user-guide/preferences/manage-your-mobile-notifications>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, for threads you\'re following when you\'re \@mentioned or
the messages contain a keyword you\'re tracking.

Tip
:::

- Mattermost auto-follows you on all direct and group messages, any
  thread you start, as well as any thread where you\'ve been
  `@mentioned </end-user-guide/collaborate/mention-people>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} directly.
- You can choose to
  `follow or unfollow any thread <end-user-guide/collaborate/organize-conversations:follow threads and messages>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} at any time.
::::

You won\'t receive notifications for threads you\'re not following, or
thread replies when they don\'t \@mention you directly. However, blue
message indicators show you unread thread replies you\'re not following
in a given public or private channel.

For all other messages, a channel appears bolded to indicate unread
messages.

## Customize your notifications

### Follow all threads in channels automatically

You can follow all threads in a channel automatically by going to
**Channel Settings \> Notification Preferences \> Follow all threads in
this channel and enable the Automatically follow threads in this
channel**.

### Get notified when threaded discussions are disabled

If your organization doesn\'t use threaded discussions, or you have
`opted out of threaded discussions <end-user-guide/preferences/manage-your-display-options:threaded discussions>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, you can configure Mattermost to notify you when someone
replies to a thread you started, or have participated in. Go to
**Settings \> Notifications \> Reply notifications** to choose one of 3
options:

- Receive notifications for messages in reply threads that you either
  start or participate in.
- Receive notifications on messages, but only in threads that you start.
- Don\'t receive notifications on messages in reply threads unless
  you\'re directly \@mentioned.

### Send automatic replies to direct messages

Want to automatically reply to direct messages when you\'re out of
office? When your system admin
`enables the ability for you to do so <administration-guide/configure/experimental-configuration-settings:enable automatic replies>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, you can configure Mattermost to send custom replies to
direct messages by going to **Settings \> Notifications \> Automatic
Direct Message Replies**, selecting **Enable**, and composing your
automatic reply message.

## Frequently asked questions

### Are thread notification counts the same across all Mattermost clients?

No. Mobile app notifications only indicate unread threads with
\@mentions, and not general unread activity.

Using Mattermost in a web browser or the desktop app, the **Threads**
list bolds unread threads that don\'t contain \@mentions.
