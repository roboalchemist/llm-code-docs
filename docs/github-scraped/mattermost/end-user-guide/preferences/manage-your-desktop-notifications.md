## Enable notifications

From Mattermost v9.9 and desktop app v5.5, Mattermost prompts you to
enable notifications in the desktop app the first time you connect to a
Mattermost server.

![An example of a Mattermost desktop app notification prompt.](../../images/desktop-notification-prompt.png)

- When you select **Allow**, you won\'t be asked again. You\'ll start
  receiving notifications in the desktop app for all Mattermost activity
  with [badges](#badge-based-notifications), [banner
  alerts](#banner-alerts) and [sounds](#notification-sounds). See the
  section below on [customizing your
  notifications](#customize-your-notifications) based on how you prefer
  to be notified about Mattermost activity in the desktop app.
- If you dismiss this prompt, you won\'t receive Mattermost
  notifications in the desktop app, and you\'ll be prompted again the
  next time you open Mattermost in the desktop app, or go to **Settings
  \> Notifications \> Desktop and mobile notifications**.
- If you select **Deny** or **Deny Permanently**, you won\'t be asked
  again. You won\'t receive Mattermost notifications in the desktop app.
  You can change this preference by
  `editing the server connection <end-user-guide/preferences/connect-multiple-workspaces:edit a server>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} to
  `manage your notification permissions <end-user-guide/preferences/connect-multiple-workspaces:manage system permissions>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.

## Badge-based notifications

Mattermost desktop app icons display the following types of badges:

- A numbered badge for unread
  `direct <end-user-guide/collaborate/channel-types:direct message channels>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}
  `group <end-user-guide/collaborate/channel-types:group message channels>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} messages,
  `@mentions </end-user-guide/preferences/manage-your-mentions-keywords-notifications>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}, and
  `keywords </end-user-guide/preferences/manage-your-mentions-keywords-notifications>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} you\'re actively watching.
  ![A numbered badge means you have at least 1 unread message, @mention, or one of your keywords has triggered a notification.](../../images/numbered-badge.png){width="50px"}
- A dot badge for unread activity.
  ![A dot on the badge means you have unread activity in at least one channel you\'re a member of.](../../images/dot-badge.png){width="50px"}

## Banner alerts

Banner alerts in the desktop app are popup windows that display for a
limited time in the top right corner of your screen that summarizes the
new activity.

## Notification sounds

By default, desktop app notifications include audible sounds.

## Customize your notifications

By default, you are notified when you\'re \@mentioned, when you receive
a direct or group message, or for matches to keywords you\'re following.

Want to receive notifications about replies to threads you're following?
Select **Notify me about replies to threads I'm following**.

Want notifications for all new messages? Select **Desktop and mobile
notifications \> All new messages**

Desktop app users can also
`customize their desktop app experience </end-user-guide/preferences/customize-desktop-app-experience>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} further based on their platform operating system.

### Change or disable sounds

You can change or disable notification sounds by going to **Desktop
notification sounds \> Message notification sound**.

### Incoming Call notifications

Want to hear a sound when a Mattermost call starts? If your Mattermost
admin
`enables this Beta feature <administration-guide/configure/plugins-configuration-settings:enable call ringing>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, you can choose the sound that plays when a call is started
within a direct or group message by going to **Desktop notification
sounds \> Incoming call sound**.

### Disable all desktop notifications

Select **Desktop and mobile notifications \> Nothing** to disable all
desktop and
`web notifications </end-user-guide/preferences/manage-your-web-notifications>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

Clear the **Use different settings for my mobile devices** to
additionally disable all Mattermost mobile notifications everywhere you
use Mattermost.

Additionally, macOS users can disable notifications for all unread
activity in the desktop app by
`customizing your desktop app experience </end-user-guide/preferences/customize-desktop-app-experience>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} to disable the **Show red badge on Dock icon to indicate
unread messages** option.

## Frequently asked questions

### What does a Mattermost icon with an exclamation point mean?

![A Mattermost logo with an exclamation point means you\'re logged out of at least 1 Mattermost server you connect to using the desktop app.](../../images/server-logout-indicator.png)

A Mattermost icon with an exclamation point means that you\'re logged
out of at least 1 Mattermost server you connect to using the desktop
app. Log back in to any servers as needed. See the
`Connect to multiple workspaces </end-user-guide/preferences/connect-multiple-workspaces>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} documentation for details.

If the icon continues to display, refresh the **Playbooks** and/or
**Boards** tabs located at the top of the desktop app window.
