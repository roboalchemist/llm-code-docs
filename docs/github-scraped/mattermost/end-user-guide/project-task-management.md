With Boards you can:

- **Manage projects and organize tasks:** A familiar kanban board
  structure integrated with channel-based communication.
- **Manage and collaborate on various projects:** Software releases,
  product launches, meetings, personal to-do's, events, etc.
- **Stay on schedule:** Clearly-defined tasks, owners, checklists,
  deadlines, and calendars.
- **Increase transparency and keep everybody in the loop:** Everything
  your team needs in one place, including documents, images, and links
  that are visible to every stakeholder.

## Install Boards

role="doc"} documentation to learn how to install and configure the
Boards plugin for your Mattermost instance.

## What\'s a board?

A board is a collection of cards to help you manage your projects,
organize tasks, and collaborate with your team all in one place.

Boards can be displayed and filtered in different views such as kanban,
table, calendar, and gallery views to help you visualize work items in
the format that makes most sense to you. Learn about
`working with boards </end-user-guide/project-management/work-with-boards>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

## What\'s a card?

Cards are used on a board to track individual work items. Cards are
customizable and can have a number of properties added to them, which
are then used as a way to tag, sort, and filter the cards.

When working with cards, you can manage properties, add descriptions,
attach images, assign them to team members, mention team members, add
comments, and so on. Learn more about
`working with cards </end-user-guide/project-management/work-with-cards>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.
