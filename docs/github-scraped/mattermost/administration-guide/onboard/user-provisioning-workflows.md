# Provisioning workflows {#user-provisoning}

This document provides an overview of user provisioning and
deprovisioning workflows in Mattermost.

There are currently 3 recommended user provisioning workflows in
Mattermost:

1. **On demand:** If user accounts are not pre-provisioned using one of
    the methods described below, then a new user account will be
    provisioned when the user first logs in. When the user logs in, they
    are asked to select a public team to join (all users must belong to
    at least one team) and then they are added automatically to the Town
    Square channel. Mattermost also has a
    `default channel setting <administration-guide/configure/experimental-configuration-settings:default channels>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} that enables system admins to add everyone to additional
    channels specified by the organization.
2. **Pre-provisioned via bulk import:** Mattermost features a
    `bulk data loading tool </administration-guide/onboard/bulk-loading-data>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} that can be used for pre-provisioning new users by
    adding them to teams and channels before their first login to
    Mattermost. This tool automates the creation of Teams, Channels,
    Users, and Posts (with file attachments). It can also be used to
    migrate users and content from an existing system.
3. **Mattermost API:** The Mattermost [RESTful
    API](https://api.mattermost.com) can be used to pre-provision new
    user accounts as well as add and remove them from teams and
    channels. This model is commonly used by enterprises that have
    central account provisioning applications.

## Mattermost user identifier

The user identifier used to uniquely identify users in Mattermost
depends on the method of authentication:

- **Email/password**: Email address or username. Created by the user or
  previously described account pre-provisioning process.
- **AD/LDAP**: Configure a unique and unchanging ID Attribute from the
  AD/LDAP server to be used in Mattermost. If a user\'s ID Attribute
  changes, it will create a new Mattermost account unassociated with
  their old one.
- **SAML 2.0**: Selected during configuration. You may use an Id
  Attribute instead of email to bind the user. We recommend choosing an
  ID that is unique and will not change over time.

### User deprovisioning

Users in Mattermost can be deactivated in the following ways:

- **AD/LDAP Synchronization**: AD/LDAP users can be deactivated in
  Mattermost based on their status in the directory server via
  synchronization. Learn more in
  `AD/LDAP documentation <administration-guide/onboard/ad-ldap:how do i deactivate users?>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.
- **System Console**: User management screen in **System Console \>
  Users** allows system admins to deactiveate users with email/password
  login. See the
  `Deactivate users <administration-guide/configure/user-management-configuration-settings:deactivate users>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} documentation for details.
- **RESTful API** The Mattermost API can be used to deactivate users.
  See [API documentation to learn
  more](https://api.mattermost.com/#operation/DeleteUser).
- **Command Line Interface**: You can use the Mattermost
  `mmctl user deactivate <administration-guide/manage/mmctl-command-line-tool:mmctl user deactivate>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} command to deactivate users.

Once deactivated, users still exist in the Mattermost database and their
messages can still be viewed in Mattermost. You can use the
`mmctl <administration-guide/manage/mmctl-command-line-tool:mmctl user delete>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} tools to delete a user and all of their content.

From Mattermost v10.10, when a user is deactivated, the account\'s
`availability <end-user-guide/preferences/set-your-status-availability:set your availability>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} is automatically set to offline.

Note

As long as the ID attribute selected via AD/LDAP or SAML 2.0 is a unique
identifier, the user's email address or name (along with other
attributes) can be updated without breaking the user's account.
