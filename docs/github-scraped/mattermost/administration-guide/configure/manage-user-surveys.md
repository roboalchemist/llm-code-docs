# Manage user surveys

In a self-hosted Mattermost deployment, you can use the Mattermost User
Survey integration to gather direct feedback from your Mattermost users
to identify what\'s working well and what\'s not with your Mattermost
instance.

All user responses are stored in and remain within your self-hosted
deployment, and no telemetry data is sent back to Mattermost. You can
export a CSV report of NPS scores and user responses for further
analysis, or to share your feedback data with Mattermost. You can
schedule when each survey begins, define how long each survey lasts,
specify teams excluded from the survey, as well as customize both a
welcome message and a user question you want feedback on.

The User Satisfaction Survey Plugin is the recommended approach for
gathering user feedback, replacing the deprecated
`User Satisfaction Survey Plugin </administration-guide/manage/user-satisfaction-surveys>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} for new deployments.
::::

## Setup

You must be a Mattermost system admin to [upload the plugin](#upload) to
your Mattermost self-hosted deployment [enable it](#enable), [create
surveys](#create-surveys), and [export survey
responses](#export-survey-responses) using the System Console.

The User Survey integration is compatible with Mattermost v9.11.2 or
later.

## Install

From Mattermost v9.11.2 (ESR) and Mattermost Cloud v10, this plugin is
pre-packaged with the Mattermost Server. If your Mattermost deployment
is on a prior release, download the [latest plugin binary
release](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-user-survey/releases),
and upload it to your server via **System Console \> Plugin
Management**.

### Upgrade

We recommend updating this integration as new versions are released.
Generally, updates are seamless and don\'t interrupt the user experience
in Mattermost.

Visit the [Releases
page](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-user-survey/releases)
for the latest release, available releases, and compatibiilty
considerations.

## Enable

Go to **System Console \> Plugins \> User Survey** to enable this
integration.

Once the integration is installed and enabled, create surveys by
completing configuration in the System Console, as described below.

### Create surveys

Under **Survey setup**, specify the date, time, and details for a new
survey:

1. **Send next survey at**: Specify the date and time when the survey
    will begin rolling out to users.

> A single survey can be active at a time. If you already have an active
> survey running, you\'ll need to reschedule your new survey to start on
> a date after the current survey expires. Alternatively, you can end
> the active survey early by selecting **End survey**.
> ::::

1. **Survey expiry (days)**: Specify how long the survey will be open
    to responses in days.
2. **Exclude specific teams**: Specify who will receive the survey. You
    can send the survey to all users, to all users on specific teams, or
    omit all users from specific teams.

1. **Survey message text**: Customize the introductory message text
    users see when prompted to complete the survey.
2. **Linear scale question (1-10)**: This question is required that
    helps calculate the NPS score.
3. **Textual question**: This question is required that helps gather
    user feedback.
4. **Textual question (Optional)**: You can optionally specify a
    text-based question for your survey.
5. Select **Save**. Your new survey is scheduled, and displays under
    **Active and past surveys** once the survey is shared with users.

## Active surveys

When a survey starts, all users recieve a direct message from a feedback
bot containing the active survey. The survey includes one mandatory
scale-based question, and optional text-based questions.

Users must answer all required questions in order to submit their
response. When a user selects **Submit**, their responses are recorded.

## Export survey responses

Select **Export responses** to download a CSV file containing NPS scores
and user responses gatherered through the survey. You can export data
from active surveys which will contain data collected so far.
