# Command line tools

In self-managed deployments, a `mattermost` command is available for
configuring the system from the directory where the Mattermost server is
installed. For an overview of the Mattermost command line interface
(CLI), [read this
article](https://medium.com/@santosjs/plugging-in-to-the-mattermost-cli-8cdcef2bd1f6)
from Santos.

Important

From Mattermost v6.0, the majority of these CLI commands have been
replaced with equivalents available using the
`mmctl command line tool </administration-guide/manage/mmctl-command-line-tool>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. However,
`mattermost import <administration-guide/manage/command-line-tools:mattermost import>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} commands,
`mattermost export <administration-guide/manage/command-line-tools:mattermost export>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} commands, and related subcommands, remain available and
fully supported from Mattermost v6.0.
::::

These `mattermost` commands include the following functionality:

**Compliance Export**

- Export data
- Schedule an export job

**Database**

- Initialize the database, execute migrations, and load custom defaults
- Migrate the database schema for unapplied migrations
- Reset the database to its initial state
- Return the most recently applied version number
- Roll back database migrations

**Server Operations**

- Start the Mattermost job server
- Run the Mattermost server
- Display Mattermost version information

## Use the CLI

::::: tab
Via Mattermost

To run the CLI commands, you must be in the Mattermost root directory.
On a default installation of Mattermost, the root directory is
`/opt/mattermost`. If you followed our standard
`installation process </deployment-guide/deployment-guide-index>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, you must run the commands as the user `mattermost`. The
name of the executable is `mattermost`, and it can be found in the
`/opt/mattermost/bin` directory.

For example, to get the Mattermost version on a default installation of
Mattermost:

``` sh
cd /opt/mattermost/
sudo -u mattermost bin/mattermost version
```

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

- Ensure you run the Mattermost binary as the `mattermost` user. Running
  it as `root` user (for example) may cause complications with
  permissions as the binary initiates plugins and accesses various files
  when running CLI commands. Running the server as `root` may result in
  ownership of the plugins and files to be overwritten as well as other
  potential permissions errors.

- When running CLI commands on a Mattermost installation that has the
  configuration stored in the database, you might need to pass the
  database connection string as:

  ``` sh
  bin/mattermost --config="postgres://mmuser:mostest@localhost:5432/mattermost_test?sslmode=disable\u0026connect_timeout=10"
  ```

::::
:::::

::::: tab
Via GitLab Omnibus

On GitLab Omnibus, you must be in the following directory when you run
CLI commands: `/opt/gitlab/embedded/service/mattermost`. Also, you must
run the commands as the user *mattermost* and specify the location of
the configuration file. The executable is
`/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/mattermost`.

For example, to get the Mattermost version on GitLab Omnibus:

``` sh
cd /opt/gitlab/embedded/service/mattermost
sudo /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/chpst -e /opt/gitlab/etc/mattermost/env -P -U mattermost:mattermost -u mattermost:mattermost /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/mattermost version
```

:::: note

Note
:::

The example commands on this documentation page are for a default
installation of Mattermost. You must modify the commands so that they
work on GitLab Omnibus.
::::
:::::

::: tab
Via Docker Install

On Docker install, the `/mattermost/bin` directory was added to `PATH`,
so you can use the CLI directly with the `docker exec` command. Note
that the container name may be `mattermostdocker_app_1` if you installed
Mattermost with `docker-compose.yml`.

For example, to get the Mattermost version on a Docker Install:

``` sh
docker exec -it <your-mattermost-container-name> mattermost version
```

::: tab
Via Docker Preview

The Docker Install tab details and command references below also apply
to the [Mattermost docker preview
image](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-docker-preview).

\- The CLI is run in a single node which bypasses the mechanisms that a
`High Availability environment </administration-guide/scale/high-availability-cluster-based-deployment>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} uses to perform actions across all nodes in the cluster. As
a result, when running
`CLI commands </administration-guide/manage/command-line-tools>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} in a High Availability environment, tasks that change
configuration settings require a server restart. - Parameters in CLI
commands are order-specific. - If special characters (`!`, `|`, `(`,
`)`, `\`, `'`, or `"`) are used, the entire argument needs to be
surrounded by single quotes, or the individual characters need to be
escaped out.

## Troubleshooting

### Executing a command hangs and doesn\'t complete

If you have Bleve search indexing enabled, temporarily disable it in
**System Console \> Experimental \> Bleve** and run the command again.
You can also optionally use the new
`mmctl Command Line Tool </administration-guide/manage/mmctl-command-line-tool>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

Bleve does not support multiple processes opening and manipulating the
same index. Therefore, if the Mattermost server is running, an attempt
to run the CLI will lock when trying to open the indeces.

If you aren\'t using the Bleve search indexing, feel free to post in our
[Troubleshooting forum](https://forum.mattermost.com/c/trouble-shoot/16)
to get help.
