# Mattermost error codes

Mattermost is designed to deploy in private networks which may be
disconnected or "air-gapped" from the internet. In these deployments,
links to Mattermost's online documentation may be unavailable.

Therefore, Mattermost error codes are provided to enable administrators
to use internet connected machines to look up error messages and
resolutions in online resources, including Mattermost documentation and
user forums, as well as providing Mattermost support teams a concise way
to identify issues.

Mattermost error codes are used in logs, administrative tools, as well
as on-screen messages to concisely identify issues and connect them with
additional resources.

In advanced deployments, error codes can be overwritten by
administrators to reference internal documentation and guides.

## ERROR_SAFETY_LIMITS_EXCEEDED

A safety limits exceeded error (`ERROR_SAFETY_LIMITS_EXCEEDED`) displays
in the
`free version of Mattermost <product-overview/editions-and-offerings:mattermost team edition>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, and certain functionality may be limited, when usage
grossly exceeds the recommended limit for users in a safe deployment,
including more than 250 users are registered on the server.

250 users represents a "high upper limit" for deployments that are
approximately 5 times the recommended size, which is far beyond the
intended design of the product.

The free version of Mattermost is intended for approximately 50 users.
If your Mattermost materially exceeds this recommended size, system
admins should seek to either [purchase a commercial
license](https://mattermost.com/pricing/), or apply for a
`non-profit subscription </product-overview/non-profit-subscriptions>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} license. Alternatively, admins can
`deactivate users <administration-guide/configure/user-management-configuration-settings:deactivate users>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} until the user count falls below the high upper limit.

## ERROR_LICENSED_USERS_LIMIT_EXCEEDED

A licensed user limit exceeded error
(`ERROR_LICENSED_USERS_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`) displays when attempting to
create or activate users on a licensed Mattermost server where the user
count would exceed the maximum number of users allowed by the license.

This error occurs when:

- Creating new users would exceed the license user limit.
- Activating deactivated users would exceed the license user limit.

To resolve this error, system administrators can:

- `Deactivate users <administration-guide/configure/user-management-configuration-settings:deactivate users>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} to reduce the active user count below the license limit.
- Contact [Mattermost Sales](https://mattermost.com/contact-sales/) to
  request an updated license that increases the number of licensed
  users.
