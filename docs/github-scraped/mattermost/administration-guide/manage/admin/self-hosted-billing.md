# Self-hosted billing

Mattermost commercial plans are offered as an annual subscription
service. With your purchase you\'re provided with a license key.
Depending on which version of Mattermost you\'re on, you may have to
download and apply this license manually via the System Console.

When you upgrade to commercial plan, the number of user seats you need
has to be equal to or greater than your current number of activated
users (formerly called active users).

You can add new users to your deployment at any time. Every quarter,
during the true-up review (section 3.5 License True-up Review of
Software License Agreement, also referenced in docs), we check the
license license seat count relative to number of activated users. If
there\'s a difference, we\'ll provide you with a new invoice which is
payable immediately.

Please see the
`self-hosted subscriptions documentation <product-overview/self-hosted-subscriptions:buy a subscription>`{.interpreted-text
