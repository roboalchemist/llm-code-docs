# mmctl command line tool

The mmctl is a CLI tool for the Mattermost server which is installed
locally and uses the Mattermost API, but may also be used remotely.
Authentication is done with either login credentials or an
authentication token. This mmctl tool is included and replaces the
`CLI </administration-guide/manage/command-line-tools>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. The mmctl can currently be used alongside the Mattermost
CLI tool. The Mattermost CLI tool will be deprecated in a future
release.

Being installed locally enables system admins for both self-hosted and
Cloud Mattermost instances to run CLI commands even in instances where
there\'s no access to the server (e.g., via SSH).

This feature was developed to a large extent by community contributions
and we\'d like to extend our gratitude to the contributors who have
worked on this project. We are currently accepting pull requests for
Help Wanted issues in the
[mattermost-server](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Help+Wanted%22+label%3AArea%2Fmmctl)
repo. You can learn more about the unit test coverage campaign for mmctl
in the [Unit testing mmctl
commands](https://mattermost.com/blog/unit-testing-mmctl-commands/) blog
post.

## mmctl usage notes

- System admins have two ways to run `mmctl` commands: by downloading
  `mmctl` from the release URLs, which you can find in the [installation
  instructions](#install-mmctl), or by building it directly, for which
  you can check the [build instructions](#build-mmctl) below. The source
  code lives in the [server/cmd/mmctl directory within the mattermost
  repository](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/tree/master/server/cmd/mmctl).
- `mmctl` also comes bundled with the Mattermost distribution, and is
  located in the `bin` folder of the installation, next to the `CLI`.
  - We recommend you add the path to the Mattermost `bin` folder into
    your `$PATH` environment variable. This ensures that you can run
    mmctl commands locally regardless of your current directory
    location.
  - If the `bin` directory is not added to the `$PATH` environment
    variable, each time you use mmctl you must be in the `bin` directory
    to run mmctl commands, and the commands must be prefixed with `./`.
    If you\'re working from a different directory, make sure you specify
    the full path to mmctl when running mmctl commands.
- Parameters in mmctl commands are order-specific.
- You can use the `--local` flag with mmctl commands to run them without
  authentication by allowing communicating with the server through a
  Unix socket. See the [local mode](#local-mode) documentation for
  activation and usage details.
- If special characters (`!`, `|`, `(`, `)`, `\`, `'`, and `"`) are
  used, the entire argument needs to be surrounded by single quotes
  (e.g. `-password 'mypassword!'`, or the individual characters need to
  be escaped out (e.g. `password mypassword\!`).
- Team name and channel name refer to the handles, not the display
  names. So in the URL
  `https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/town-square` team name
  would be `core` and channel name would be `town-square`.

## Install mmctl

The mmctl tool comes bundled with Mattermost package. For customers that
want to setup it independently from the package, the following methods
are available to install mmctl.

:::: {#install-mmctl-options}
::: tab
Release package

If you\'re using a release page for Linux, macOS, or Windows, we
recommend downloading the mmctl builds through their release URL:
`https://releases.mattermost.com/mmctl/${MATTERMOST_VERSION}/${PLATFORM}_${ARCHITECTURE}.tar`
(for windows, substitute the `.tar` suffix with `.zip`)

E.g. to download version `v10.7.0` of the mmctl amd64 build for linux,
you can run the following:

``` sh
curl -vfsSL -O https://releases.mattermost.com/mmctl/v10.7.0/linux_amd64.tar
```

Supported platforms, and corresponding supported architectures include
linux (amd64 and arm64), darwin (amd64 and arm64), windows (amd64 only).
:::
::::

::: tab
Local git clone

You can build mmctl from a local Git clone to work directly with the
source code, use the latest features, and experiment with custom
changes. This workflow is ideal if you need a tailored version of mmctl,
want to fix bugs, or test new updates before they're officially
released.

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost.git
cd mattermost/server
go install ./cmd/mmctl
```

:::

::: tab
Homebrew

**On Linux or macOS, this isn\'t an officially supported method** This
installation channel is managed by the community. Please refer to the
[homebrew/homebrew-core repo](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core)
for reporting issues.

Use this option on Linux and macOS if you have Homebrew installed.

``` sh
brew install mmctl
```

:::

## Build mmctl

::: {#build-mmctl}
The `mmctl` tool uses `go` modules to manage dependencies, so you need
to have installed `go` 1.19 or greater on your machine.
:::

After checking out the [mattermost
repository](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost) locally to your
machine, from the root directory of the project, you can compile the
mmctl binary by running:

``` sh
make -C server mmctl-build
```

## Local mode

**Local mode is available for self-hosted deployments only.**

Local mode allows platform administrators with access to the Mattermost
server to run mmctl commands against the API without needing to have a
user registered. To ensure secure usage of this API, the server exposes
a local socket that only a user with access to the server\'s file system
can access. The requests coming from the socket are treated as
authorized, so they can reach the handlers without requiring a user
session.

The API that the socket exposes follows the same specification that can
be found [in the API documentation](https://api.mattermost.com), so
mmctl is able to interact with it without needing any modifications.
When a request comes in through the socket, it is flagged as local by
the server, and this flag is taken into account when checking for
session permissions to correctly authorize the sessions.

### Activating local mode

To use local mode, the Mattermost server first needs to
`have local mode enabled <administration-guide/configure/experimental-configuration-settings:enable local mode for mmctl>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. When local mode is enabled, a socket is created at
`/var/tmp/mattermost_local.socket` by default.

:::: tip
::: title
Tip
:::

When trying to use local mode with mmctl, ensure you\'re using the same
user when running the server and mmctl, or clean up the socket file
before switching to a new user. If you encounter an error like
`socket file "/var/tmp/mattermost_local.socket" doesn't exists, please check the server configuration for local mode`,
this can be resolved by setting this configuration setting to `true`.
::::

### Using local mode

From Mattermost v10.8, when no authentication credentials are found in
the authentication configuration, mmctl automatically assumes local
mode, eliminating the need to manually append the `--local` flag to the
command you want to use. When valid credentials exist, Mattermost will
continue to validate them as expected.

Prior to Mattermost v10.8, you must append `--local` to the command you
want to use, or set the environment variable as `MMCTL_LOCAL=true`.

To use a socket file other than the default, you need to set the
environment variable to `MMCTL_LOCAL_SOCKET_PATH`. This file must match
the
`server configuration setting <administration-guide/configure/experimental-configuration-settings:enable local mode socket location>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

## Running mmctl tests

**Available for self-hosted deployments only.**

mmctl has two types of tests: unit tests and end to end tests.

To execute them, you can run the following commands from the mattermost
project root directory:

``` sh
# For the unit tests
make -C server test-mmctl-unit

# For the end to end tests
make -C server test-mmctl-e2e
```

### mmctl auth login

**Description**

Log in to an instance and store credentials. You can log in with [a
personal access
token](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/reference/personal-access-token)
instead of using username/password. See [access tokens](#access-tokens)
for details.

**Format**

``` sh
mmctl auth login [instance url] --name [server name] --username [username] --password-file [password-file] [flags]
```

**Examples**

``` sh
mmctl auth login https://mattermost.example.com
mmctl auth login https://mattermost.example.com --name local-server --username sysadmin --password-file mysupersecret.txt
mmctl auth login https://mattermost.example.com --name local-server --username sysadmin --password-file mysupersecret.txt --mfa-token 123456
mmctl auth login https://mattermost.example.com --name local-server --access-token myaccesstoken
```

**Options**

``` text
-t, --access-token-file string   Access token file to be read to use instead of username/password
-h, --help                       help for login
-m, --mfa-token string           MFA token for the credentials
-n, --name string                Name for the credentials
    --no-activate                If present, it won't activate the credentials after login
-f, --password-file string       Password file to be read for the credentials
-u, --username string            Username for the credentials
```

**Options inherited from parent commands**

``` sh
--config string                path to the configuration file (default "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mmctl/config")
--disable-pager                disables paged output
--insecure-sha1-intermediate   allows to use insecure TLS protocols, such as SHA-1
--insecure-tls-version         allows to use TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1
--json                         the output format will be in json format
--local                        allows communicating with the server through a unix socket
--quiet                        prevent mmctl to generate output for the commands
--strict                       will only run commands if the mmctl version matches the server one
--suppress-warnings            disables printing warning messages
```

#### Password

``` sh
mmctl auth login https://community.mattermost.com --name community --username my-username --password-file mysupersecret
```

The `login` command can also work interactively, so if you leave any
required flag empty, `mmctl` will ask you for it interactively:

``` sh
$ mmctl auth login https://community.mattermost.com
Connection name: community
Username: my-username
Password File:
```

#### MFA

To log in with MFA, use the `--mfa-token` flag:

``` sh
mmctl auth login https://community.mattermost.com --name community --username my-username --password-file mysupersecret --mfa-token 123456
```

#### Access tokens

You can generate and use a personal access token to authenticate with a
server, instead of using username and password to log in:

``` sh
mmctl auth login https://community.mattermost.com --name community --access-token MY_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

Alternatively, you can log in to your Mattermost server with a username
and password:

``` sh
$ mmctl auth login https://my-instance.example.com --name my-instance --username john.doe --password-file mysupersecret
credentials for my-instance: john.doe@https://my-instance.example.com stored
```

We can check the currently stored credentials with:

``` sh
$ mmctl auth list

| Active |        Name | Username |                     InstanceUrl |
|--------|-------------|----------|---------------------------------|
|      * | my-instance | john.doe | https://my-instance.example.com |
```

And now we can run commands normally:

``` sh
$ mmctl user search john.doe
id: qykfw3t933y38k57ubct77iu9c
username: john.doe
nickname:
position:
first_name: John
last_name: Doe
email: john.doe@example.com
auth_service:
auth_data:
```

#### Installing shell completions

mmctl supports shell completions for bash, fish, powershell, and zsh
from Mattermost v11.

To install the shell completions for **bash**, add the following line to
your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile` file:

``` sh
source <(mmctl completion bash)
```

For **zsh**, add the following line to your `~/.zshrc` file:

``` sh
source <(mmctl completion zsh)
```

For **fish**, add the following line to your fish configuration:

``` sh
mmctl completion fish | source
```

For **powershell**, add the following line to your PowerShell profile:

``` powershell
mmctl completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```

### mmctl compliance-export create

**Description**

Create a new compliance export job to archive channel messages, direct
messages, file uploads, and posts from plugins, bots, or webhooks.
Supported export formats include CSV, Actiance XML, and Global Relay EML
for integration with third-party compliance systems.

> - If `--date` is set, the job will run for one day, from 12am to 12am
>   (minus one millisecond) inclusively.
> - Running a compliance export job from mmctl will NOT affect the next
>   scheduled job\'s `batch_start_time`. This means that if you run a
>   compliance export job from mmctl, the next scheduled job will run
>   from the `batch_end_time` of the previous scheduled job, as usual.

**Format**

``` sh
mmctl compliance-export create [complianceExportType] --date "2025-03-27 -0400" [flags]
```

### mmctl config migrate

**Description**

Migrate a file-based configuration to (or from) a database-based

to start using it. This command only migrates the configuration data
from one type to another.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

- To change the store type to use the database, a system admin needs to
  set a `MM_CONFIG`
  `environment variable <administration-guide/configure/configuration-in-your-database:create an environment file>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} and restart the Mattermost server.

- The `migrate` function requires local mode to be enabled. To do this,
  add the following line to your Mattermost Environment file:

  > ``` sh
  > MM_SERVICESETTINGS_ENABLELOCALMODE=true
  > ```
>
::::

**Format**

``` sh
mmctl config migrate [from_config] [to_config] [flags]

### mmctl ldap idmigrate

**Description**

Migrate LDAP `IdAttribute` to a new value. Run this utility to change
the value of your ID Attribute without your users losing their accounts.
After running the command, you can change the ID Attribute to the new
value in the System Console. For example, if your current ID Attribute
was `sAMAccountName` and you wanted to change it to `objectGUID`, you
would:

1. Wait for an off-peak time when your users won't be impacted by a
    server restart.
2. Run the command `mmctl ldap idmigrate objectGUID`.
3. Update the config within the System Console to the new value
    `objectGUID`.
4. Restart the Mattermost server.

``` sh
mmctl ldap idmigrate <objectGUID> [flags]
```

**Examples**

``` sh
mmctl ldap idmigrate objectGUID
```

**Options**

``` sh
-h, --help   help for idmigrate

see in the channel sidebar. Your `team-URL` does not contain spaces. Run
the [mmctl team list](#mmctl-team-list) command to return a list of all
teams on the server in `team-URL` format. See the
`team name and URL selection <end-user-guide/collaborate/organize-using-teams:team name and url selection>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} documentation for details.

``` sh
# Update SAML authentication data for a user
mmctl user edit authdata john.doe newsamlid@example.com

### mmctl user edit email

**Description**

Edit user email address. This command is particularly useful for
SAML-authenticated users who need to change their email addresses when
the SAML configuration uses email as the ID attribute. This provides a
safer alternative to direct database manipulation.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

From Mattermost v10.9, email addresses enclosed in angle brackets (e.g.,
`<billy@example.com>`) will be rejected. To avoid issues, ensure all
user emails comply with the plain address format (e.g.,
`billy@example.com`). In addition, we strongly recommend taking
proactive steps to audit and update Mattermost user data to align with
this product change, as impacted users may face issues accessing
Mattermost or managing their user profile. You can update these user
emails manually using this mmctl command:
`mmctl user edit email "<affecteduser@domain.com>" affecteduser@domain.com`.
::::

**Format**

``` sh
mmctl user edit email [user] [new email] [flags]
```

**Examples**

``` sh
# Change email for a SAML-authenticated user
mmctl user edit email john.doe newemail@example.com

# Update email for a user identified by current email

This command is especially important for SAML environments where email
is used as the ID attribute. Previously, changing email addresses for
SAML users required direct database manipulation, which posed security
and operational risks.

### mmctl user email

This command is deprecated in favor of
`mmctl user edit email <administration-guide/manage/mmctl-command-line-tool:mmctl user edit email>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

**Description**

Change the email address associated with a user.

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

From Mattermost v10.9, email addresses enclosed in angle brackets (e.g.,
`<billy@example.com>`) will be rejected. To avoid issues, ensure all
user emails comply with the plain address format (e.g.,
`billy@example.com`). In addition, we strongly recommend taking
proactive steps to audit and update Mattermost user data to align with
this product change, as impacted users may face issues accessing
Mattermost or managing their user profile. You can update these user
emails manually using this mmctl command:
`mmctl user edit email "<affecteduser@domain.com>" affecteduser@domain.com`.
