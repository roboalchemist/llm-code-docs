# Upgrade Mattermost Server

In most cases, you can upgrade Mattermost Server in a few minutes.
However, the upgrade can take longer depending on several factors,
including the size and complexity of your installation, and the version
that you\'re upgrading from.

If this is your first Mattermost upgrade, we recommend that you read the
[comprehensive upgrade guide](#comprehensive-upgrade-guide) below. If
you\'re an experienced system admin familiar with the upgrade process,
see the [quick start checklist](#quick-start).

## Quick start

Experienced system admins looking for a quick overview of the Mattermost
upgrade process can use the following 4-step checklist below:

1. Ensure you have a complete backup of your system before proceeding,
    including database and application.
2. **System requirements**: Verify that your server and PostgreSQL
    version meets
    `Mattermost requirements </deployment-guide/software-hardware-requirements>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"}.
3. **Preparation steps**

> - Download the latest server version.
> - Extract the new files to a temporary location (`/tmp`)
> - Identify the current Mattermost directory (default:
>   `/opt/mattermost`)

1. **Upgrade process**

> - Stop the Mattermost service: `sudo systemctl stop mattermost`
> - Remove old application files (preserve config, data, logs, plugins).
> - Copy new files to the install directory.
> - Change file ownership:
>   `sudo chown -R mattermost:mattermost mattermost`
> - Set capabilities for low port usage if needed:
>   `sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep ./mattermost/bin/mattermost`
> - Start the Mattermost service: `sudo systemctl start mattermost`
> - Remove temporary upgrade files.

For detailed instructions and additional considerations, see the
complete upgrade guide below.

## Comprehensive upgrade guide

### Before you begin

**Read these instructions carefully from start to finish.**

:::: important

**Before upgrading to Mattermost v11.0**: If you\'re currently using
Bleve search (found under **System Console \> Experimental \> Bleve**),
ensure that `DisableDatabaseSearch` is set to `false` before upgrading,
or search will become non-functional after the upgrade. Bleve search has
been removed in v11.0. For enterprise search capabilities, consider
migrating to
`Elasticsearch </administration-guide/scale/elasticsearch-setup>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} or
`OpenSearch </administration-guide/scale/opensearch-setup>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} for
`enterprise search </administration-guide/scale/enterprise-search>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} capabilities.
::::

Make sure that you understand how to
`prepare for your upgrade </administration-guide/upgrade/prepare-to-upgrade-mattermost>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, familiarize yourself with all
`software and hardware requirements </deployment-guide/software-hardware-requirements>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}, read the
`important upgrade notes </administration-guide/upgrade/important-upgrade-notes>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} and that you understand each step of the upgrade process
documented below before starting a Mattermost upgrade. If you have
questions or concerns, you can ask on the Mattermost forum at
<https://forum.mattermost.com/>.

**Gather the following information before starting the upgrade:**

- **Existing install directory - {install-path}**: If you don\'t know
  where Mattermost Server is installed, use the `whereis mattermost`
  command to find standard binary places and \$PATH.
  - This command won\'t return anything if `/opt/mattermost/bin` wasn\'t
    added to the PATH.
  - Alternatively, you can use the
    `find / -executable -type f -iname mattermost 2> /dev/null` command
    to find the `mattermost` binary.
  - The output should be similar to `/opt/mattermost/bin/mattermost`.
  - The install directory is everything before the first occurrence of
    the string `/mattermost`. In this example, the `{install-path}` is
    `/opt`.
  - If that command doesn\'t produce any results, it\'s likely because
    your version is older; try `whereis platform` instead.
- **Location and size of your local storage directory**: The local
  storage directory contains all the files that users have attached to
  their messages.
  - If you don\'t know its location, open the System Console and go to
    **Environment \> File Storage**, then read the value in **Local
    Storage Directory**.
  - Paths are relative to the `mattermost` directory. For example, if
    the local storage directory is `./data/` then the absolute path is
    `{install-path}/mattermost/data`.
- **Database disk space**: If you\'re upgrading a Mattermost deployment
  on the same server as your database, we recommend a minimum 2GB of
  free disk space to allow for extraction, copy, and cleanup, and a
  minimum of twice the size of your Mattermost installation available
  for the database.

Consider generating a migration plan using the
`mattermost db migrate --save-plan <administration-guide/manage/command-line-tools:mattermost db migrate>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} CLI command when upgrading to have a detailed record of the
changes that will be applied to your database. This can make it easier
to revert those changes if you need to downgrade later.

### Upgrade Mattermost Server

1. In a terminal window on the server that hosts Mattermost, change to
    your home directory. Delete any files and directories that might
    still exist from a previous download.

    ``` sh
    cd /tmp
    ```

2. Download [the latest version of Mattermost
    Server](https://mattermost.com/download/) based on your Mattermost
    edition.

> ::: tab
> Enterprise Edition
>
> In the following command, replace `X.X.X` with the version that you
> want to download:
>
> ``` sh
> wget https://releases.mattermost.com/X.X.X/mattermost-X.X.X-linux-amd64.tar.gz

> ```
>
> :::

1. Confirm no other Mattermost zip folders exist in your `/tmp`
    directory. If another version\'s zip file does exist, delete or
    rename the file.

    ``` sh
    ls -- mattermost*.gz
    ```

    If anything except the new release is returned above, rename this
    file or delete it completely.

2. Extract the Mattermost Server files.

    ``` sh
    tar -xf mattermost*.gz --transform='s,^[^/]\+,\0-upgrade,'
    ```

    The `transform` option adds a suffix to the topmost extracted
    directory so it does not conflict with the usual install directory.

3. Stop your Mattermost server.

    ``` sh
    sudo systemctl stop mattermost
    ```

4. Back up your data and application. Make sure you\'ve properly backed
    up your database before continuing with the upgrade. In case of an
    unexpected failure, you should be in a position to load a previous
    database snapshot.

    a.  Back up your database using your organization's standard
        procedures for backing up the database.

    b.  Back up your application by copying into an archive folder (e.g.
        `mattermost-back-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm`).

        ``` sh
        cd {install-path}
        sudo cp -ra mattermost/ mattermost-back-$(date +'%F-%H-%M')/
        ```

5. Remove all files **except** data and custom directories from within
    the current `mattermost` directory. We strongly recommend reading
    the important note below before executing the following command.

    ``` sh
    sudo find mattermost/ mattermost/client/ -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 \! \( -type d \( -path mattermost/client -o -path mattermost/client/plugins -o -path mattermost/config -o -path mattermost/logs -o -path mattermost/plugins -o -path mattermost/data \) -prune \) | sort | sudo xargs rm -r
    ```

    :::: important
    ::: title
    Important
    :::

    By default, the following subdirectories will be preserved on
    upgrade:`config`, `logs`, `plugins`, `client/plugins`, and `data`.
    Custom directories and ANY other directories that you\'ve added to
    Mattermost are NOT preserved by default. Generally, these are TLS
    keys or other custom information, but can also include a different
    directories configured for local storage other than `data`, as well
    as custom directories used to store attachments.

    Before continuing with your upgrade, we strongly recommend that you:

    a.  Run `ls` on your Mattermost install directory to identify all
        default folders that exist prior to upgrading.

        A default Mattermost installation has the following files and
        directories:

        ``` sh
        $ ls /opt/mattermost
        ENTERPRISE-EDITION-LICENSE.txt README.md  client  data   i18n  manifest.txt  prepackaged_plugins
        NOTICE.txt                      bin        config  fonts  logs  plugins       templates
        ```

    b.  Perform a dry run of deleting the contents of the `mattermost`
        folder and preserving only the specified directories and their
        contents by running the following command. It\'s the same
        command listed above, but it omits `sudo xargs rm -r`:

        ``` sh
        sudo find mattermost/ mattermost/client/ -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 \! \( -type d \( -path mattermost/client -o -path mattermost/client/plugins -o -path mattermost/config -o -path mattermost/logs -o -path mattermost/plugins -o -path mattermost/data \) -prune \) | sort
        ```

    c.  If you store TLSCert/TLSKey files or other information within
        your `/opt/mattermost` folder, you need to append
        `-o -path mattermost/yourFolderHere` to the command above to
        avoid having to manually copy the TLSCert/TLSKey files from the
        backup into the new install.

        ``` sh
        sudo find mattermost/ mattermost/client/ -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 \! \( -type d \( -path mattermost/client -o -path mattermost/client/plugins -o -path mattermost/config -o -path mattermost/logs -o -path mattermost/plugins -o -path mattermost/data -o -path  mattermost/yourFolderHere \) -prune \) | sort
        ```

    d.  If you\'re using
        `Bleve search </administration-guide/configure/bleve-search>`{.interpreted-text
        role="doc"}, and the directory exists *within* the `mattermost`
        directory, the index directory path won\'t be preserved using
        the command above.

        - You can either move the bleve index directory out from the
          `mattermost` directory before upgrading or, following an
          upgrade, you can copy the contents of the bleve index
          directory from the `backup` directory.
        - You can then store that directory or re-index as preferred.
        - The bleve indexes can be migrated without reindexing between
          Mattermost versions. See our
          `Configuration Settings <administration-guide/configure/deprecated-configuration-settings:bleve settings>`{.interpreted-text
          role="ref"} documentation for details on configuring the bleve
          index directory.

    Once you\'ve completed all of the steps above (where applicable),
    you\'re ready to execute the full command that includes
    `xargs rm -r` to delete the files. Note that the following example
    includes `-o -path mattermost/yourFolderHere`:

    ``` sh
    sudo find mattermost/ mattermost/client/ -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 \! \( -type d \( -path mattermost/client -o -path mattermost/client/plugins -o -path mattermost/config -o -path mattermost/logs -o -path mattermost/plugins -o -path mattermost/data -o -path  mattermost/yourFolderHere \) -prune \) | sort | sudo xargs rm -r
    ```

    ::::

6. Copy the new files to your install directory.

    ``` sh
    sudo cp -an /tmp/mattermost-upgrade/. mattermost/
    ```

    :::: note
    ::: title
    Note
    :::

    The `n` (no-clobber) flag and trailing `.` on source are very
    important. The `n` (no-clobber) flag preserves existing
    configurations and logs in your installation path. The trailing `.`
    on source ensures all installation files are copied.
    ::::

7. Change ownership of the new files after copying them. For example:

    ``` sh
    sudo chown -R mattermost:mattermost mattermost
    ```

    :::: note
    ::: title
    Note
    :::

    - If you didn\'t use `mattermost` as the owner and group of the
      install directory, run
      `sudo chown -hR {owner}:{group} {install-path}/mattermost`.
    - If you\'re uncertain what owner or group was defined, use the
      `ls -l {install-path}/mattermost/bin/mattermost` command to obtain
      them.
    ::::

8. If you want to use port 80 or 443 to serve your server, and/or if
    you have TLS set up on your Mattermost server, you **must** activate
    the `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` capability to allow the new Mattermost
    binary to bind to ports lower than 1024. For example:

    ``` sh
    sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep ./mattermost/bin/mattermost
    ```

9. Start your Mattermost server.

    ``` sh
    sudo systemctl start mattermost
    ```

10. Remove the temporary files.

    ``` sh
    sudo rm -r /tmp/mattermost-upgrade/
    sudo rm -i /tmp/mattermost*.gz
    ```

11. If you\'re using a
    `high availability </administration-guide/scale/high-availability-cluster-based-deployment>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} deployment, you need to apply the steps above on every
    node in your cluster. Once complete, the **Config File MD5** columns
    in the high availability section of the System Console should be
    green. If they\'re yellow, please ensure that all nodes have the
    same server version and the same configuration.

    If they continue to display as yellow, trigger a configuration
    propagation across the cluster by opening the System Console,
    changing a setting, and reverting it. This will enable the **Save**
    button for that page. Then, select **Save**. This will not change
    any configuration, but sends the existing configuration to all nodes
    in the cluster.

After the server is upgraded, users might need to refresh their browsers
to experience any new features.

## Upgrade Team Edition to Enterprise Edition
