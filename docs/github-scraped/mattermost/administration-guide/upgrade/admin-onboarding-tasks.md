# Administrator onboarding tasks

This document provides instructions for common administrator tasks,
including some recommendations on tasks to prepare your Mattermost
deployment to onboard users.

## Getting started tasks

1. Once you\'ve installed and deployed Mattermost, ensure all
    configuration settings are appropriately set under **System Console
    \> Environment** including:

> - Web server
> - Database
> - File storage
> - SMTP
> - Push Notification server

These settings can also be set in the `config.json` file. Please see our
`configuration settings documentation </administration-guide/configure/configuration-settings>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} for a full listing of all configuration settings.

1. Adjust settings under **System Console \> Site Configuration** to
    brand and customize how users will interact with the site. Be sure
    to update the Support Email and Help Link in Mattermost under
    **System Console \> Site Configuration \> Customization** to provide
    your users a resource for password resets or questions on their
    Mattermost account.

> - The Support email is used on email notifications and during tutorial
>   for users to ask support questions.
> - The Help Link is on the Mattermost login page, sign-up pages, and
>   Main Menu and can be used to to link to your help desk ticketing
>   system.

These settings can also be set in the `config.json` file. Please see our
`configuration settings documentation </administration-guide/configure/configuration-settings>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} for a full listing of all configuration settings.

1. Begin to onboard users by enabling account creation or by connecting
    an authentication service to assist with user provisioning.

- Users can be pre-provisioned with migration and bulk loading data
  processes based on prior collaboration systems. Please see our
  `migration guide <administration-guide/onboard/migrating-to-mattermost:migration guide>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} and
  `bulk loading documentation </administration-guide/onboard/bulk-loading-data>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} for additional details.
- `AD/LDAP authentication </administration-guide/onboard/ad-ldap>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} and
  `SAML authentication </administration-guide/onboard/sso-saml>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} are available for some subscription plans, providing
  identity management, single sign-on, and automatic account
  provisioning.

If your organization requires more structure and project management
artifacts for the implementation of Mattermost, please see our
`Enterprise roll out checklist </administration-guide/upgrade/enterprise-roll-out-checklist>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

## Important administration notes

**DO NOT manipulate the Mattermost database**

- In particular, DO NOT manually delete data from the database directly.
  Mattermost is designed as a continuous archive and cannot be supported
  after manual manipulation.
- If you need to permanently delete a team or user, use the
  `mmctl user delete <administration-guide/manage/mmctl-command-line-tool:mmctl user delete>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} command or the
  `mmctl user deletall <administration-guide/manage/mmctl-command-line-tool:mmctl user deleteall>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} command.

## Common tasks

**Creating System admin account from the command line**

- If the System admin leaves the organization or is otherwise
  unavailable, you can use the
  `mmctl roles <administration-guide/manage/mmctl-command-line-tool:mmctl roles>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} commands to assign the *system_admin* role to an existing
  user.
- The user needs to log out and log back in before the *system_admin*
  role is applied.

**Migrating to AD/LDAP or SAML from email-based authentication**

- If you have a Mattermost Enterprise or Professional plan, you can
  migrate from email authentication to Active Directory/LDAP or to SAML
  Single Sign-on. To set up Active Directory/LDAP, see
  `Active Directory/LDAP Setup </administration-guide/onboard/ad-ldap>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}. To set up SAML Single Sign-on, see
  `SAML Single-Sign-On </administration-guide/onboard/sso-saml>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"}.
- After the new authentication method is enabled, existing users cannot
  use the new method until they go to **Settings \> Security \> Sign-in
  method** and select **Switch to using AD/LDAP** or **Switch to using
  SAML Single Sign-on**. After they have switched, they can no longer
  use their email and password to log in.

**Deactivating a user**

- System admins can go to **System Console \> Users** for a list of all
  users on the server. The list can be searched and filtered to make
  finding the user easier. Click the user\'s role and in the menu that
  opens, click **Deactivate**.
- To preserve audit history, users are typically never deleted from the
  system. If permanently deleting a user is necessary (e.g. for the
  purposes of [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/)), an
  `mmctl command </administration-guide/manage/mmctl-command-line-tool>`{.interpreted-text
  role="doc"} can be used to do so.
- Note that AD/LDAP user accounts cannot be deactivated from Mattermost;
  they must be deactivated from your Active Directory.

**Checking for a valid license in Enterprise Edition without logging
in**

- Open the log file `mattermost.log`. It\'s usually in the
  `mattermost/logs/` directory but might be elsewhere on your system.
  Find the last occurrence of a log entry that starts with the text
  `[INFO] License key`. If the license key is valid, the complete line
  should be similar to the following example:

``` text
[2017/05/19 16:51:40 UTC] [INFO] License key valid unlocking enterprise features.
```

## User experience optimizations

We highly recommend the following best practices, configuration options,
and features for an optimal Mattermost user experience.

**1. Upgrade your Mattermost server**

When you upgrade your Mattermost server frequently, your users can
access new features, improved user experiences, bug fixes, security
fixes, and mobile app compatibility.

Mattermost releases regular updates to [Mattermost Team
Edition](https://mattermost.com/) and [Mattermost Enterprise
Edition](https://mattermost.com/pricing/). See the
`release life cycle </product-overview/releases-lifecycle>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} documentation for component life cycle details details.

Upgrading your Mattermost server only takes a few minutes. See the
`Upgrade Guide </administration-guide/upgrade/upgrading-mattermost-server>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} for step-by-step instructions.

**2. Install plugins**

You can enable plugins and integrations to connect your team\'s
workflows and toolsets into Mattermost. Plugins and integrations
customize and extend the Mattermost platform.

**Install and manage plugins**

To enable and manage plugins, go to **System Console \> Plugins**. Next,
install plugins from **Product menu \> Marketplace**. See the
[Marketplace](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/admin-guide/admin-plugins-beta/#marketplace)
documentation for details.

Consider installing, configuring, and enabling the following community integrations for your users:

**Enable and manage integrations**

To enable integrations such as webhooks, slash commands, OAuth2.0, and
bots, to go **System Console \> Integrations**. More information on
these integrations can be found
[here](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/other-integrations/).

**3. Enable automatically extended sessions**

Keep your desktop and mobile users logged in and [extend user sessions
automatically](https://mattermost.com/blog/session-expiry-experience/)
by setting **System Console \> Sessions \> Extend session length with
activity** to **true**. See the
`Extend session length with activity <administration-guide/configure/environment-configuration-settings:extend session length with activity>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} configuration settings documentation for details.

**4. Enable full content push notifications**

Enable push notifications on mobile devices to deliver messages in real
time by setting **System Console \> Push Notification Server \> Enable
Push Notifications** to **Use TPNS**. See the
`Push notification server <administration-guide/configure/environment-configuration-settings:push notification server>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} configuration settings documentation for details.

Enable full content push notifications, including the sender's name, the
channel name, and the message text, by setting **System Console \>
Notifications \> Push Notification Contents** to **Full message
contents**. See the
`Push notification contents <administration-guide/configure/site-configuration-settings:push notification contents>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} configuration settings documentation for details.

Note
:::

- Mattermost subscription plans allow you to enable HPNS that includes
  production-level uptime SLAs.
- Mattermost Enterprise customers can
  `enable ID-Only push notifications <administration-guide/configure/site-configuration-settings:push notification contents>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} so push notification content is not passed through Apple
  Push Notification Service (APNS) or Google Firebase Cloud Messaging
  (FCM) before reaching the device. The ID-only push notification
  setting [offers a high level of
  privacy](https://mattermost.com/blog/id-only-push-notifications/)
  while allowing team members to benefit from mobile push notifications.

**5. Enable custom emoji**

`Emojis </end-user-guide/collaborate/react-with-emojis-gifs>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} enable users to express concepts such as emotions and
physical gestures in messages. Enable the emoji picker by setting
**System Console \> Emoji \> Enable Emoji Picker** to **true**. See the
`Enable emoji picker <administration-guide/configure/site-configuration-settings:enable emoji picker>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} configuration settings documentation for details.

Empower users to create and share their own custom emojis by setting
**System Console \> Emoji \> Enable Custom Emoji** to **true**. See the
`Enable custom emoji <administration-guide/configure/site-configuration-settings:enable custom emoji>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} configuration settings documentation for details.

**6. Enable GIF picker**

GIFs are animated images that can make messaging more fun and engaging.
Enable users to access the Mattermost GIF picker from the message draft
area by setting **System Console \> GIF (Beta) \> Enable GIF Picker** to
**true**. See the
`Enable GIF picker <administration-guide/configure/integrations-configuration-settings:enable gif picker>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} configuration settings documentation for details.

**7. Enable link previews**

Link previews provide a visual glimpse of relevant content for links
shared in messages. Enable link previews by setting **System Console \>
Posts \> Enable Link Previews** to **true**. See the
`Enable link previews <administration-guide/configure/site-configuration-settings:enable website link previews>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} configuration settings documentation for details.

**8. Enable batched email notifications**

Email notifications can be batched together so users don't get
overwhelmed with too many emails.

Enable email notifications first by setting **System Console \>
Notifications \> Enable Email Notifications** to **true**. See the
`Enable email notifications <administration-guide/configure/site-configuration-settings:enable email notifications>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} configuration settings documentation for details. Note that
email notifications require an
`SMTP email server <administration-guide/configure/environment-configuration-settings:smtp server>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} to be configured.

Then, enable batched email notifications by setting **System Console \>
Notifications \> Enable Email Batching** to **true**. See the
`Enable email batching <administration-guide/configure/site-configuration-settings:enable email batching>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} configuration settings documentation for details. Note that
email batching is not available if you are running your deployment in
`High Availability </administration-guide/scale/high-availability-cluster-based-deployment>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.

**9. Enable Elasticsearch**

Mattermost Enterprise customers can enable
`enterprise search </administration-guide/scale/enterprise-search>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} for optimized search performance at enterprise-scale. Both
Elasticsearch and AWS OpenSearch solve many known issues with full text
database search, such as dots, dashes, and email addresses returning
unexpected results.

Enable Elasticsearch by setting **System Console \> Elasticsearch \>
Enable Indexing** to **true**. See the
`Elasticsearch <administration-guide/configure/environment-configuration-settings:enterprise search>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} configuration settings documentation for details. Enabling
Elasticsearch requires
`setting up an Elasticsearch server <administration-guide/scale/elasticsearch-setup:set up elasticsearch>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.
