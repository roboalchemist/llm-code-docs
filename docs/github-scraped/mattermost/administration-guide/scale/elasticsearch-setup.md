# Elasticsearch server setup

Elasticsearch allows you to search large volumes of data quickly, in
near real-time, by creating and managing an index of post data. The
indexing process can be managed from the System Console after setting up
and connecting an Elasticsearch server. The post index is stored on the
Elasticsearch server and updated constantly after new posts are made. In
order to index existing posts, a bulk index of the entire post database
must be generated.

Deploying Elasticsearch includes the following two steps: [setting up
Elasticsearch](#set-up-elasticsearch), and [configuring
Mattermost](#configure-mattermost).

## Set up Elasticsearch

We highly recommend that you set up Elasticsearch server on a dedicated
machine separate from the Mattermost Server.

1. Download and install the latest release of [Elasticsearch
    v8](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.15/install-elasticsearch.html),
    or [Elasticsearch
    v7.17+](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/install-elasticsearch.html).
    See the Elasticsearch documentation for installation details.
2. Set up Elasticsearch with `systemd` by running the following
    commands:

> ``` sh
> sudo /bin/systemctl daemon-reload
> sudo /bin/systemctl enable elasticsearch.service
> sudo systemctl start elasticsearch.service
> ```

1. Confirm Elasticsearch is working on the server by running the
    following command:

> ``` sh
> curl localhost:9200
> ```

1. Get your network interface name by running the following command:

> ``` sh
> ip addr
> ```

1. Edit the Elasticsearch configuration file in `vi` by running the
    following command:

> ``` sh
> vi /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
> ```

1. In this file, replace the `network.host` value of `_eth0_` with your
    network interface name, and save your changes.
2. When using Elasticsearch v8, ensure you set
    `action.destructive_requires_name` to `false` in `elasticsearch.yml`
    to allow for wildcard operations to work.
3. Restart Elasticsearch by running the following commands:

> ``` sh
> sudo systemctl stop elasticsearch
> sudo systemctl start elasticsearch
> ```

1. Confirm the ports are listenings by running the following command:

> ``` sh
> netstat -plnt
> ```
>
> You should see the following ports, including the ones listening on
> ports 9200 and 9300. Confirm these are listening on your server\'s IP
> address.

1. Create an Elasticsearch directory and give it the proper
    permissions.
2. Install the [icu-analyzer
    plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/current/analysis-icu.html)
    to the `/usr/share/elasticsearch/plugins` directory by running the
    following command:

> ``` sh
> sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-plugin install analysis-icu
> ```

1. Test the connection from Mattermost to Elasticsearch by running the
    following command:

> ``` sh
> curl 172.31.80.220:9200
> ```

## Configure Mattermost

Follow these steps to configure Mattermost to use your Elasticsearch
server and to generate the post index:

1. Go to **System Console \> Environment \> Elasticsearch**.
2. Set **Enable Elasticsearch Indexing** to `true` to enable the other
    the settings on the page. Once the configuration is saved, new posts
    made to the database are automatically indexed on the Elasticsearch
    server.
3. Ensure **Backend type** is set to `elasticsearch`.
