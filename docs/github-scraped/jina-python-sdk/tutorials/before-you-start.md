# Source: https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/blob/master/docs/tutorials/before-you-start.md(before-start)=# Before you startBefore you jump in to any tutorials, we recommend you do the following:## Understand Jina-serveRead through an {ref}`introduction to Jina concepts <architecture-overview>` to understand the basic components that will be used in the tutorial.## Work in a virtual environmentWe highly recommend you work in [a virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to prevent conflicts in packaging versions. This applies not just to Jina-serve, but Python as a whole.## Install Jina-serveFor most purposes, you can install Jina-serve with:```shellpip install jina```For more installation options, see {ref}`our installation guide <install>`.## Python vs YAMLJina-serve supports YAML in many circumstances for easier deployment. For more information, see our {ref}`guide on coding in Python and YAML in Jina <python-yaml>`.
