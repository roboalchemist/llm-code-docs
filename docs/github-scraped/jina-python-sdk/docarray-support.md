# Source: https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/blob/master/docs/docarray-support.md(docarray-support)=# DocArray supportJina-serve depends heavily on DocArray to provide the data that is processed inside Jina-serve Executors and sent by our Clients.Recently, DocArray was heavily refactored for version 0.30.Starting from that version, DocArray usage  has changed drastically, however Jina-serve can work seamlessly and automatically with any of the versions of Jina-serve.Jina-serve will automatically detect the docarray version installed and use the corresponding methods and APIs. However, developersmust take into account that some APIs and usages have changed, especially when it comes to developing Executors.The new version makes the dataclass feature of DocArray<0.30 a first-class citizen and for thispurpose it is built on top of [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/). An important shift is thatthe new DocArray adapts to users' data, whereas DocArray<0.30 forces user to adapt to the Document schema.## Document schemaAt the heart of DocArray>=0.30 is a new schema that is more flexible and expressive than the original DocArray schema.You can refer to the [DocArray README](https://github.com/docarray/docarray) for more details.Please note that also the names of data structure change in the new version of DocArray.TODO: ADD snippets for both versionsOn the Jina-serve side, this flexibility extends to every Executor, where you can now customize input and output schemas:- With DocArray<0.30 a Document has a fixed schema in the input and the output- With DocArray>=0.30 (the version currently used by default in Jina-serve), an Executor defines its own input and output schemas.It also provides several predefined schemas that you can use out of the box.## Executor APITo reflect the change with DocArray >=0.30, the Executor API supports schema definition. Thedesign is inspired by [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).The main difference, is that for `docarray<0.30` there is only a single [Document](https://docarray.org/legacy-docs/fundamentals/document/) with a fixed schema.However, with `docarray>=0.30` user needs to define their own `Document` by subclassing from [BaseDoc](https://docs.docarray.org/user_guide/representing/first_step/) or taking any of the [predefined Document types](https://docs.docarray.org/data_types/first_steps/) provided.````{tab} docarray>=0.30```{code-block} pythonfrom jina import Executor, requestsfrom docarray import DocList, BaseDocfrom docarray.documents import ImageDocfrom docarray.typing import AnyTensorimport numpy as npclass InputDoc(BaseDoc):    img: ImageDocclass OutputDoc(BaseDoc):    embedding: AnyTensorclass MyExec(Executor):    @requests(on='/bar')    def bar(        self, docs: DocList[InputDoc], **kwargs    ) -> DocList[OutputDoc]:        docs_return = DocList[OutputDoc](            [OutputDoc(embedding=np.zeros((100, 1))) for _ in range(len(docs))]        )        return docs_return```````````{tab} docarray<0.30```{code-block} pythonfrom jina import Executor, requestsfrom docarray import Document, DocumentArrayimport numpy as npclass MyExec(Executor):    @requests(on='/bar')    def bar(        self, docs: DocumentArray, **kwargs    ):        docs_return = DocumentArray(            [Document(embedding=np.zeros((100, 1))) for _ in range(len(docs))]        )        return docs_return```````To ease with the transition from the old to the new `docarray` versions, there is the [`LegacyDocument`](https://docs.docarray.org/API_reference/documents/documents/#docarray.documents.legacy.LegacyDocument) which is a predefined Document that aims to providethe same data type as the original `Document` in `docarray<0.30`.## Client APIIn the client, the big change is that when using `docarray>=0.30`. you specify the schema that you expect the Deployment or Flow to return. You can pass the return type by using the `return_type` parameter in the `client.post` method:````{tab} docarray>=0.30```{code-block} pythonfrom jina import Clientfrom docarray import DocList, BaseDocfrom docarray.documents import ImageDocfrom docarray.typing import AnyTensorclass InputDoc(BaseDoc):    img: ImageDocclass OutputDoc(BaseDoc):    embedding: AnyTensorc = Client(host='')c.post('/', DocList[InputDoc]([InputDoc(img=ImageDoc()) for _ in range(10)]), return_type=DocList[OutputDoc])```````````{tab} docarray<0.30```{code-block} pythonfrom jina import Clientfrom docarray import DocumentArray, Documentc = Client(host='')c.post('/', DocumentArray([Document() for _ in range(10)]))```````## See also- [DocArray>=0.30](https://docs.docarray.org/) docs- [DocArray<0.30](https://docarray.org/legacy-docs/) docs- [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) documentation for more details on the schema definition
