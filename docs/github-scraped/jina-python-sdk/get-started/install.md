# Source: https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/blob/master/docs/get-started/install.md(install)=# {octicon}`desktop-download` InstallJina-serve comes with multiple installation options, enabling different feature sets.Standard install enables all major features of Jina-serve and is the recommended installation for most users.````{tab} via PyPI```shellpip install -U jina```````````{tab} via Conda```shellconda install jina -c conda-forge```````````{tab} via Docker```shelldocker run jinaai/jina:latest```````## More install optionsVersion identifiers [are explained here](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/blob/master/RELEASE.md).### MinimumMinimum install enables basic features of Jina-serve, but without support for HTTP, WebSocket, Docker and Hub.Minimum install is often used when building and deploying an Executor.````{tab} via PyPI```shellJINA_PIP_INSTALL_CORE=1 pip install jina```````````{tab} via Conda```shellconda install jina-core -c conda-forge```````````{tab} via Docker```shelldocker run jinaai/jina:latest```````### Minimum but more performantSame as minimum install, but also install `uvloop` and `lz4`.````{tab} via PyPI```shellJINA_PIP_INSTALL_PERF=1 pip install jina```````````{tab} via Conda```shellconda install jina-perf -c conda-forge```````````{tab} via Docker```shelldocker run jinaai/jina:latest-perf```````### Full development dependenciesThis installs additional dependencies, useful for developing Jina-serve itself. This includes Pytest, CI components etc.````{tab} via PyPI```shellpip install "jina[devel]"```````````{tab} via Docker```shelldocker run jinaai/jina:latest-devel```````### PrereleasePrerelease is the version always synced with the `master` branch of Jina-serve's GitHub repository.````{tab} via PyPI```shellpip install --pre jina```````````{tab} via Docker```shelldocker run jinaai/jina:master```````## Autocomplete commands on Bash, Zsh and FishAfter installing Jina via `pip`, you should be able to use your shell's autocomplete feature while using Jina's CLI. For example, typing `jina` then hitting your Tab key will provide the following suggestions:```bashjina--help          --version       --version-full  check           client          flow            gateway         hello             pod             ping            deployment            hub```The autocomplete is context-aware. It also works when you type a second-level argument:```bashjina hub--help  new     pull    push```Currently, the feature is enabled automatically on Bash, Zsh and Fish. It requires you to have a standard shell path as follows:| Shell | Configuration file path      || ---   | ---                          || Bash  | `~/.bashrc`                  || Zsh   | `~/.zshrc`                   || Fish  | `~/.config/fish/config.fish` |
