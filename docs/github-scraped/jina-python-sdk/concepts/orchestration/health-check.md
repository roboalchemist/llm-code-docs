# Source: https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/blob/master/docs/concepts/orchestration/health-check.md# Health CheckOnce an Orchestration is running, you can use `jina ping` [CLI](../../api/jina_cli.rst) to run a health check of the complete Orchestration or (in the case of a Flow) individual Executors or Gateway.````{tab} DeploymentStart a Deployment in Python:```pythonfrom jina import Deploymentdep = Deployment(protocol='grpc', port=12345)with dep:    dep.block()```Check the readiness of the Deployment:```bashjina ping deployment grpc://localhost:12345```````````{tab} FlowStart a Flow in Python:```pythonfrom jina import Flowf = Flow(protocol='grpc', port=12345).add(port=12346)with f:    f.block()```Check the readiness of the Flow:```bashjina ping flow grpc://localhost:12345```You can also check the readiness of an individual Executor:```bashjina ping executor localhost:12346```...or the readiness of the Gateway service:```bashjina ping gateway  grpc://localhost:12345```````When these commands succeed, you should see something like:```textINFO   JINA@28600 readiness check succeeded 1 times!!!``````{admonition} Use in Kubernetes:class: noteThe CLI exits with code 1 when the readiness check is not successful, which makes it a good choice to be used as readinessProbe for Executor and Gateway whendeployed in Kubernetes.```
