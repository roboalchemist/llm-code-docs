# Source: https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/blob/master/docs/concepts/orchestration/yaml-vars.md## VariablesJina-serve Orchestration YAML supports variables and variable substitution according to the [GitHub Actions syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/environment-variables).### Environment variablesUse `${{ ENV.VAR }}` to refer to the environment variable `VAR`. You can find all {ref}`Jina environment variables here<jina-env-vars>`.### Context variablesUse `${{ CONTEXT.VAR }}` to refer to the context variable `VAR`.Context variables can be passed in the form of a Python dictionary:````{tab} Deployment```pythondep = Deployment.load_config('deployment.yml', context={...})```````````{tab} Flow```pythonf = Flow.load_config('flow.yml', context={...})```````### Relative pathsUse `${{root.path.to.var}}` to refer to the variable `var` within the same YAML file, found at the provided path in the file's structure.```{admonition} Syntax: Environment variable vs relative path:class: tipThe only difference between environment variable syntax and relative path syntax is the omission of spaces in the latter.```
