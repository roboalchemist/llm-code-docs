# Source: https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/blob/master/docs/concepts/orchestration/index.md(orchestration)=# {fas}`network-wired` OrchestrationAs seen in the {ref}`architecture overview <architecture-overview>`, Jina-serve is organized in different layers.The Orchestration layer is composed of concepts that let you orchestrate, serve and scale your Executors with ease.Two objects belong to this family:- A single Executor ({class}`~Deployment`), ideal for serving a single model or microservice.- A pipeline of Executors ({class}`~Flow`), ideal for more complex operations where Documents need to be processed in multiple ways.Both Deployment and Flow share similar syntax and behavior. The main differences are:- Deployments orchestrate a single Executor, while Flows orchestrate multiple Executors connected into a pipeline.- Flows have a {ref}`Gateway <gateway>`, while Deployments do not.```{toctree}:hidden:deploymentflowadd-executorsscale-outhot-reloadhandle-exceptionsreadinesshealth-checkinstrumentationtroubleshooting-on-multiprocessyaml-spec```
