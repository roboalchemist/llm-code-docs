# Source: https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/blob/master/docs/concepts/serving/gateway/health-check.md(health-check-gateway)=# Health CheckJust like each individual Executors, the Gateway also exposes a health check endpoint.In contrast to Executors however, a Gateway can use gRPC, HTTP, or WebSocketss, and the health check endpoint changes accordingly.## Using gRPCWhen using gRPC as the protocol to communicate with the Gateway, the Gateway uses the exact same mechanism as Executors to expose its health status: It exposes the [standard gRPC health check](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/health-checking.md) to the outside world.With the same Flow as before, you can use the same way to check the Gateway status:```bashdocker run --network='host' fullstorydev/grpcurl -plaintext 127.0.0.1:12345 grpc.health.v1.Health/Check``````json{  "status": "SERVING"}```## Using HTTP or WebSockets````{admonition} Caution:class: cautionFor Gateways running with HTTP or WebSockets, the gRPC health check response codes outlined {ref}`above <health-check-microservices>` do not apply.Instead, an error free response signifies healthiness.````When using HTTP or WebSockets as the Gateway protocol, you can query the endpoint `'/'` to check the status.First, create a Flow with HTTP or WebSockets protocol:```pythonfrom jina import Flowf = Flow(protocol='http', port=12345).add()with f:    f.block()```Then query the "empty" endpoint:```bashcurl http://localhost:12345```You get a valid empty response indicating the Gateway's ability to serve:```json{}```
