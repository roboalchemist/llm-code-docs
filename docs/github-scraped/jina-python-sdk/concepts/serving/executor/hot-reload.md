# Source: https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/blob/master/docs/concepts/serving/executor/hot-reload.md(reload-executor)=## Hot ReloadWhile developing your Executor, it can be useful to have the Executor be refreshed from the source code while you are working on it.For this you can use the Executor's `reload` argument to watch changes in the source code and the Executor YAML configuration and ensure changes are applied to the served Executor.The Executor will keep track of changes inside the Executor source and YAML files and all Python files in the Executor's folder and sub-folders).````{admonition} Caution:class: cautionThis feature aims to let developers iterate faster while developing or improving the Executor, but is not intended to be used in production environment.````````{admonition} Note:class: noteThis feature requires watchfiles>=0.18 package to be installed.````To see how this would work, let's define an Executor in `my_executor.py````pythonfrom jina import Executor, requestsfrom docarray import DocListfrom docarray.documents import TextDocclass MyExecutor(Executor):    @requests    def foo(self, docs: DocList[TextDoc], **kwargs) -> DocList[TextDoc]:        for doc in docs:            doc.text = 'I am coming from the first version of MyExecutor'```Now we'll deploy it```pythonimport osfrom jina import Deploymentfrom my_executor import MyExecutoros.environ['JINA_LOG_LEVEL'] = 'DEBUG'dep = Deployment(port=12345, uses=MyExecutor, reload=True)with dep:    dep.block()```We can see that the Executor is successfully serving:```pythonfrom jina import Clientfrom docarray import DocListfrom docarray.documents import TextDocc = Client(port=12345)print(c.post(on='/', inputs=DocList[TextDoc](TextDoc()), return_type=DocList[TextDoc])[0].text)``````textI come from the first version of MyExecutor```We can edit the Executor file and save the changes:```pythonfrom jina import Executor, requestsfrom docarray import DocListfrom docarray.documents import TextDocclass MyExecutor(Executor):    @requests    def foo(self, docs: DocList[TextDoc], **kwargs) -> DocList[TextDoc]:        for doc in docs:            doc.text = 'I am coming from a new version of MyExecutor'```You should see in the logs of the serving Executor```textINFO   executor0/rep-0@11606 detected changes in: ['XXX/XXX/XXX/my_executor.py']. Refreshing the Executor```And after this, the Executor will start serving with the renewed code.```pythonfrom jina import Clientfrom docarray import DocListfrom docarray.documents import TextDocc = Client(port=12345)print(c.post(on='/', inputs=DocList[TextDoc](TextDoc()), return_type=DocList[TextDoc])[0].text)``````text'I come from a new version of MyExecutor'```Reloading is also applied when the Executor's YAML configuration file is changed. In this case, the Executor deployment restarts.To see how this works, let's define an Executor configuration in `executor.yml`:```yamljtype: MyExecutorBeforeReload```Deploy the Executor:```pythonimport osfrom jina import Deployment, Executor, requestsfrom docarray import DocListfrom docarray.documents import TextDocos.environ['JINA_LOG_LEVEL'] = 'DEBUG'class MyExecutorBeforeReload(Executor):    @requests    def foo(self, docs: DocList[TextDoc], **kwargs) -> DocList[TextDoc]:        for doc in docs:            doc.text = 'MyExecutorBeforeReload'class MyExecutorAfterReload(Executor):    @requests    def foo(self, docs: DocList[TextDoc], **kwargs) -> DocList[TextDoc]:        for doc in docs:            doc.text = 'MyExecutorAfterReload'dep = Deployment(port=12345, uses='executor.yml', reload=True)with dep:    dep.block()```You can see that the Executor is running and serving:```pythonfrom jina import Clientfrom docarray import DocListfrom docarray.documents import TextDocc = Client(port=12345)print(c.post(on='/', inputs=DocList[TextDoc](TextDoc()), return_type=DocList[TextDoc])[0].text)``````textMyExecutorBeforeReload```You can edit the Executor YAML file and save the changes:```yamljtype: MyExecutorAfterReload```In the Flow's logs you should see:```textINFO   Flow@1843 change in Executor configuration YAML /home/user/jina/jina/exec.yml observed, restarting Executor deployment```And after this, you can see the reloaded Executor being served:```pythonfrom jina import Clientfrom docarray import DocListfrom docarray.documents import TextDocc = Client(port=12345)print(c.post(on='/', inputs=DocList[TextDoc](TextDoc()), return_type=DocList[TextDoc])[0].text)``````yamljtype: MyExecutorAfterReload```
