---

The PI4IOE5V6408 component allows you to use the Diodes Incorporated PI4IOE5V6408 8-bit I2C I/O
expander in ESPHome using the [I²C Bus](/components/i2c) for communication.

The PI4IOE5V6408 is a low-voltage 8-bit I/O port expander that operates at 1.65V to 5.5V. It provides
general-purpose remote I/O expansion for most microcontroller families via the I2C interface. The device
supports both pull-up and pull-down resistors on all I/O pins, and includes interrupt capability for
input changes.

Once configured, you can use any of the **8** pins (0-7) within your projects. Within ESPHome they
emulate a real internal GPIO pin and can therefore be used with many of ESPHome's components such as
the GPIO binary sensor or GPIO switch.

```yaml
# Example configuration entry
pi4ioe5v6408:
  - id: 'pi4ioe_hub'

# Individual outputs
switch:
  - platform: gpio
    name: "PI4IOE5V6408 Pin 0"
    pin:
      pi4ioe5v6408: pi4ioe_hub
      number: 0

# Individual inputs
binary_sensor:
  - platform: gpio
    name: "PI4IOE5V6408 Pin 1"
    pin:
      pi4ioe5v6408: pi4ioe_hub
      number: 1
```

## Configuration variables

- **id** (**Required**, [ID](/guides/configuration-types#id)): The id to use for this `pi4ioe5v6408` component.
- **address** (*Optional*, int): The I²C address of the device. Defaults to `0x43`.
- **reset** (*Optional*, boolean): Whether to reset the device state during setup. When `true` (default),
  all pins are configured as inputs with high impedance during setup. When `false`, the component will
  read the current state from the device registers. Defaults to `true`.

## Pin configuration variables

- **pi4ioe5v6408** (**Required**, [ID](/guides/configuration-types#id)): The id of the `pi4ioe5v6408` component of the pin.
- **number** (**Required**, int): The pin number. Valid range is 0-7.
- **inverted** (*Optional*, boolean): If all read and written values should be treated as inverted.
  Defaults to `false`.

- **mode** (*Optional*, [Pin Mode](/guides/configuration-types#pin-schema)): A pin mode to set for the pin. One of:

  - `INPUT` - Configure the pin as an input.
  - `OUTPUT` - Configure the pin as an output.
  - `PULLUP` - Enable internal pull-up resistor (input mode only).
  - `PULLDOWN` - Enable internal pull-down resistor (input mode only).

## Examples

### GPIO Switch Example

```yaml
switch:
  - platform: gpio
    name: "Relay 1"
    pin:
      pi4ioe5v6408: pi4ioe_hub
      number: 0
      mode:
        output: true
```

### GPIO Binary Sensor Example

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: gpio
    name: "Button 1"
    pin:
      pi4ioe5v6408: pi4ioe_hub
      number: 1
      mode:
        input: true
        pullup: true
```

### GPIO Output with Inverted Logic

```yaml
switch:
  - platform: gpio
    name: "LED Strip"
    pin:
      pi4ioe5v6408: pi4ioe_hub
      number: 2
      mode:
        output: true
      inverted: true
```
