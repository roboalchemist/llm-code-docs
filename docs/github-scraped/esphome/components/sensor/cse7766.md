The `cse7766` sensor platform allows you to use your CSE7766 voltage/current and power sensors
([datasheet](https://itead.cc/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/CSE7766.pdf)) sensors with
ESPHome. This sensor is commonly found in Sonoff POW R2. CSE7759B is similar to CSE7766
and works with this component.

> [!NOTE]
> SAFETY HAZARD: Some devices such as Sonoff POWs/Shelly/etc, have the digital GND connected directly to mains voltage so **the GPIOs become LIVE during normal operation**. Our advice is to mark these boards to prevent any use of the dangerous digital pins.

As the communication with the CSE7766 done using UART, you need
to have an [UART bus](/components/uart) in your configuration with the `rx_pin` connected to the CSE7766.
Additionally, you need to set the baud rate to 4800 and parity to EVEN. The device sends multiple updates per second, so you
will probably want some sort of averaging or throttle filter on the sensors.

```yaml
# Example configuration entry
substitutions:
  update_interval: 60s

# Disable logging over USB
logger:
  baud_rate: 0

  parity: EVEN
