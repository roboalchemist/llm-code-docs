The `tof10120` sensor platform allows you to use TOF10120 optical time of flight sensor ([datasheet](https://github.com/SoyM/TOF10120/blob/master/TOF10120.pdf))
with ESPHome to measure distances. The sensor works optically by emitting short infrared pulses
and measuring the time it takes the light to be reflected back.

The sensor can measure distances in range 10-180 centimeters, though that figure depends significantly
on several conditions like surface reflectance, field of view, temperature etc..

The [I²C Bus](/components/i2c) is
required to be set up in your configuration for this sensor to work.

```yaml
# Example configuration entry
sensor:
  - platform: tof10120
    name: "TOF10120 Distance"
    update_interval: 5s
```

## Configuration variables

- **update_interval** (*Optional*, [Time](/guides/configuration-types#time)): The interval to check the
  sensor. Defaults to `60s`.

- **address** (*Optional*, int): Manually specify the I^2C address of the sensor. Defaults to `0x52`.
- All other options from [Sensor](/components/sensor).
