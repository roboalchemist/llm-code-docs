The `t6615` sensor platform allows you to use T6613 and T6615 family sensors
([amphenol](https://amphenol-sensors.com/en/telaire/co2/525-co2-sensor-modules/319-t6615)) with ESPHome. T6613 sensors are unreferenced and require ABC to
calibrate daily, while the T6615 sensors have a sealed reference gas and
do not require ABC calibration. All ppm ranges are supported by this platform.

As the communication is done using UART, you need to have an [UART bus](/components/uart) in your configuration with the
`rx_pin` connected to the TX pin of the device (pin 10) and the `tx_pin` connected to the RX Pin of the device (pin
11). The baud rate should be set to 19200.

Additionally, the T6613/15 sensors require 5V power, while most ESP platforms only output 3.3V from their onboard
regulator, so you may need some additional components to power up the sensor.

```yaml
# Example configuration entry
sensor:
  - platform: t6615
    co2:
      name: CO2
```

## Configuration variables

- **co2** (*Optional*): The CO_2 data from the sensor in parts per million (ppm).
  All options from [Sensor](/components/sensor).

- **update_interval** (*Optional*, [Time](/guides/configuration-types#time)): The interval to check the
  sensor. Defaults to `60s`.

- **uart_id** (*Optional*, [ID](/guides/configuration-types#id)): Manually specify the ID of the [UART Component](/components/uart) if you want
  to use multiple UART buses.

- **id** (*Optional*, [ID](/guides/configuration-types#id)): Manually specify the ID used for actions.
