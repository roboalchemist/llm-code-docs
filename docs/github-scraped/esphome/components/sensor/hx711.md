The `hx711` sensor platform allows you to use your HX711
load cell amplifier
([datasheet](https://www.mouser.com/ds/2/813/hx711_english-1022875.pdf), [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13879)) with ESPHome

Connect `GND` to `GND`, `VCC` to `3.3V` and the other two `DOUT` (or `DT` for short)
and `CLK` (or `SCK`  ) to free GPIO pins.

```yaml
# Example configuration entry
sensor:
  - platform: hx711
    name: "HX711 Value"
    dout_pin: D0
    clk_pin: D1
    gain: 128
    update_interval: 60s
```

## Configuration variables

- **dout_pin** (**Required**, [Pin Schema](/guides/configuration-types#pin-schema)): The DOUT (or DAT) pin.
- **clk_pin** (**Required**, [Pin Schema](/guides/configuration-types#pin-schema)): The CLK pin.
- **gain** (*Optional*, enum): The gain. Implicitly selects the channel. Defaults to `128`.

  - `32` (Channel B, gain 32)
  - `64` (Channel A, gain 64)
  - `128` (Channel A, gain 128)

- **update_interval** (*Optional*, [Time](/guides/configuration-types#time)): The interval to check the sensor. Defaults to `60s`.

- All other options from [Sensor](/components/sensor).

## Converting Units

As the HX711 does not have any calibration data, you have to convert the measurement to units yourself.
To calibrate the sensor:

1. Place a zero load or a known mass on the sensor, for example `0kg`
1. Wait for the data to arrive in the logs and write down the value. For example `120`.
1. Place another (different) known mass on the sensor, for example `1kg`
1. Again wait for the data to arrive and note the value, for example `810`.

Once you've done those steps, you can use the `calibrate_linear` filter to map the incoming value
to the calibrated one:

```yaml
# Example configuration entry
sensor:
  - platform: hx711
    # ... Other HX711 options
    filters:
      - calibrate_linear:
          - 120 -> 0
          - 810 -> 1
    unit_of_measurement: kg
```

Replace the masses and values `120.0`, `810.0`, etc with your values.
