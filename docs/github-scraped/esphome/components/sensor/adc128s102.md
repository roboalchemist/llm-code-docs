The ADC128S102 is a low-power, eight-channel CMOS 12-bit analog-to-digital converter specified for conversion
throughput rates of 500 ksps to 1 MSPS. The converter is based on a successive-approximation register architecture
with an internal track-and-hold circuit.

## Component/Hub

The ADC128S102 component allows you to use ADC128S102 8-Channel 12-Bit A/D Converter
([datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/adc128s102.pdf),
[Texas Instruments](https://www.ti.com/product/ADC128S102)) in ESPHome.
It uses the [SPI Bus](/components/spi) for communication.

Once configured, you can use any of the 8 pins as
sensors for your projects.

```yaml
# Example configuration entry
adc128s102:
  cs_pin: GPIOXX
  id: my_adc
```

Configuration variables:

- **id** (**Required**, [ID](/guides/configuration-types#id)): The id to use for this ADC128S102 component.
- **cs_pin** (**Required**, int): The SPI cable select pin to use

## Sensor

The `adc128s102` sensor allows you to use your ADC128S102 12-Bit A/D Converter sensors with ESPHome.
First, setup a [ADC128S102 Hub](#adc128s102-component) for your ADC128S102 sensor and then use this
sensor platform to create individual sensors that will report the voltage to Home Assistant.

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: adc128s102           # Attached to pin 0 of the ADC128S102.
    update_interval: 1s
    adc128s102_id: my_adc
    id: freezer_temp_source
    channel: 0                     # ADC128S102 channel
```

Configuration variables:

- **adc128s102_id** (**Required**, [ID](/guides/configuration-types#id)): The id of the parent ADC128S102 component.
- **channel** (**Required**, int): The channel of the ADC128S102 to use.
- **update_interval** (*Optional*, [Time](/guides/configuration-types#time)): The interval to check the sensor. Defaults to `60s`.
