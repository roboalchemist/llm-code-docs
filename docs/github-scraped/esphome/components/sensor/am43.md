The `am43` sensor platform allows you to read the light and
battery sensors on an AM43 BLE cover motor. The platform connects
to the device over the ESP32's BLE peripheral.

> [!NOTE]
> This component does NOT support Tuya-based versions of this device,
> as the protocol is completely different. If your device is controlled
> with the SmartLife app, then it will not work.
