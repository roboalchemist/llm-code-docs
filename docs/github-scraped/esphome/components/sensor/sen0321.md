The `sen0321` sensor platform allows you to use your DFRobot
([product wiki](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/Gravity_IIC_Ozone_Sensor_(0-10ppm)%20SKU_SEN0321),
[DFRobot](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-2005.html)) ozone sensors with ESPHome. The sensor is used in automatic mode where the sensor actively
updates its measurements every 2 seconds.
[I²C](/components/i2c) is required to be set up in your configuration for this sensor to work.
