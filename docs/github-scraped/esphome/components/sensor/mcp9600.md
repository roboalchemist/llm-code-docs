The `mcp9600` sensor platform allows you to use your MCP9600 and MCP9601
([datasheet](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/105/040/original/MCP960X-Data-Sheet-20005426%281%29.pdf),
[Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4101)) to measure the temperature of a connected thermocouple while also measuring the ambient temperature around the sensor with ESPHome. [I²C](/components/i2c) is
required to be set up in your configuration for this sensor to work.

> [!NOTE]
> The [I²C](/components/i2c) bus must be set to a minimum of `10kHz` due to the limitations of the MCP9600 and MCP9601.

```yaml
# Example configuration entry
sensor:
  - platform: mcp9600
    hot_junction:
      name: "Thermocouple Temperature"
    cold_junction:
      name: "Ambient Temperature"
    thermocouple_type: K
    address: 0x67
    update_interval: 60s
```

## Configuration variables

- **hot_junction** (*Optional*): The information for the Hot Junction temperature sensor.

  - All options from [Sensor](/components/sensor).

- **cold_junction** (*Optional*): The information for the Cold Junction temperature sensor.

  - All options from [Sensor](/components/sensor).

- **thermocouple_type** (*Optional*): Set the thermocouple type. Options are:
  K, J, T, N, S, E, B and R type thermocouple. Defaults to `K`.

- **address** (*Optional*, int): Manually specify the I²C address of
  the sensor. Defaults to `0x67`.

- **update_interval** (*Optional*, [Time](/guides/configuration-types#time)): The interval to check the
  sensor. Defaults to `60s`.
