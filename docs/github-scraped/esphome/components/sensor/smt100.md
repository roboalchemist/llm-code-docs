The SMT100 sensor platform allows you to use the SMT100 soil moisture and temperature with ESPHome.

{{< img src="smt100.jpg" alt="Image" width="50.0%" class="align-center" >}}

The communication with this component is done via a [UART](/components/uart) using a simple ASCII protocol. You must
therefore have a `uart:` entry in your configuration with both the TX and RX pins set to some pins on your
board and the baud rate set to 9600.

```yaml
# Example configuration entry
uart:
  tx_pin: TX
  rx_pin: RX
  baud_rate: 9600

sensor:
  - platform: smt100
    counts:
        name: "Counts"
    permittivity:
        name: "Permittivity"
    temperature:
        name: "Temperature"
    moisture:
        name: "Moisture"
    voltage:
        name: "Voltage"
```

## Configuration variables

- **counts** (*Optional*): Raw measurement data from the sensor electronics (dimensionless quantity). Higher counts mean less moisture. May be used for material specific calibrations.

  - All options from [Sensor](/components/sensor).

- **permittivity** (*Optional*): Dielectric coefficient or permittivity of the material to be measured (dimensionless quantity). Higher permittivity means higher water content. May be used for material specific calibration.

  - All options from [Sensor](/components/sensor).

- **temperature** (*Optional*): Soil temperature in degrees Celsius. Please note that the temperature sensor is inside the black sensor enclosure and requires some time to equilibrate with the soil temperature.

  - All options from [Sensor](/components/sensor).

- **moisture** (*Optional*): Soil moisture (volumetric water content in %).

  - All options from [Sensor](/components/sensor).

- **voltage** (*Optional*): Supply voltage of the sensor in Volt.

  - All options from [Sensor](/components/sensor).

- **uart_id** (*Optional*, [ID](/guides/configuration-types#id)): Manually specify the ID of the [UART Component](/components/uart) if you want
  to use multiple UART buses.

- **update_interval** (*Optional*, [Time](/guides/configuration-types#time)): The interval to poll the sensor. Defaults is 60s.
