The `sds011` sensor platform allows you to use SDS011 particulate matter sensors ([datasheet](https://nettigo.pl/attachments/398))
with ESPHome.

As the communication with the SDS011 is done using UART, you need
to have an [UART bus](/components/uart) in your configuration with the `rx_pin` connected to the TX pin of the
SDS011 and optionally the `tx_pin` connected to the RX Pin of the SDS011 (it's switched because the
TX/RX labels are from the perspective of the individual device). Additionally, you need to set the baud rate to 9600.

```yaml
# Example configuration entry
uart:
  rx_pin: D0
  tx_pin: D1
  baud_rate: 9600

sensor:
  - platform: sds011
    pm_2_5:
      name: "Particulate Matter <2.5µm Concentration"
    pm_10_0:
      name: "Particulate Matter <10.0µm Concentration"
    update_interval: 5min
```

With `update_interval`, the working period of the SDS011 device will be changed. If `update_interval` is
equal to `0min`, the SDS011 will be set to continuous measurement and will report new measurement values
approximately every second.

If `update_interval` is between 1-30 minutes, the SDS011 periodically turns on for 30s before each measurement.
For the remaining time the sensor is shut off. As a result, this mode can reduce power consumption and increases
the lifetime of the SDS011.

Note that `update_interval` may not be set to `never`.

## Configuration variables

- **pm_2_5** (*Optional*): Use the concentration of particulates of size less than 2.5µm in µg per cubic meter.
  All options from [Sensor](/components/sensor).

- **pm_10_0** (*Optional*): Use the concentration of particulates of size less than 10.0µm in µg per cubic meter.
  All options from [Sensor](/components/sensor).

- **update_interval** (*Optional*, [Time](/guides/configuration-types#time)): The interval to check the sensor in minutes.
  This affects the working period of the SDS011 sensor. Defaults to `0min`.

- **rx_only** (*Optional*, boolean): Whether the sensor is connected **only by RX pin** to the UART bus.
  Since the SDS011 can not be configured in RX-only mode, `update_interval` has no effect and the sensor must be
  configured separately. Defaults to `false`.

- **uart_id** (*Optional*, [ID](/guides/configuration-types#id)): Manually specify the ID of the [UART Component](/components/uart) if you want
  to use multiple UART buses.

> [!NOTE]
> The configuration variable `update_interval` reconfigure the SDS011 device. This setting is still effective
> after power off. This can affect the performance of other libraries. Factory default is continuous measurement.
