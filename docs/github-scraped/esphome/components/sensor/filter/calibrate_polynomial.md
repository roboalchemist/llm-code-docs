{{< anchor "sensor-filter-calibrate_polynomial" >}}

Calibrate your sensor values by fitting them to polynomial functions. This is similar to
the `calibrate_linear` filter, but also allows for higher-order functions like quadratic polynomials.

```yaml
# Example configuration entry
- platform: adc
  # ...
  filters:
    - calibrate_polynomial:
       degree: 2
       datapoints:
        # Map 0.0 (from sensor) to 0.0 (true value)
        - 0.0 -> 0.0
        - 10.0 -> 12.1
        - 13.0 -> 14.0
```

The arguments are a list of data points, each in the form `MEASURED -> TRUTH`. Additionally, you need
to specify the degree of the resulting polynomial, the datapoints will then be fitted to the given
degree with a least squares solver.
