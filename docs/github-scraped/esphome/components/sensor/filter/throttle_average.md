An average over the `specified time period`, potentially throttling incoming values. When this filter gets incoming values, it sums up all values and pushes out the average after the `specified time period` passed. There are two edge cases to consider within the `specified time period`  :

* no value(s) received: `NaN` is returned - add the `heartbeat` filter if periodical pushes are required and/or `filter_out: nan` if required
* one value received: the value is pushed out after the `specified time period` passed, without calculating an average

For example a `throttle_average: 60s` will push out a value every 60 seconds, in case at least one sensor value is received within these 60 seconds.

In comparison to the `throttle` filter, it won't discard any values. In comparison to the `sliding_window_moving_average` filter, it supports variable sensor reporting rates without influencing the filter reporting interval (except for the first edge case).
