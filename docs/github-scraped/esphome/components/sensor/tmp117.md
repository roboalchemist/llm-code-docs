The TMP117 Temperature sensor allows you to use your TMP117
([datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tmp117.pdf),
[sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15805))
sensors with ESPHome.

The TMP117 is a high precision temperature sensor that communicates over I²C. Each sensor is tested on a NIST tracable test setup during Texas Instruments' production process. Accuracy should be at worst 0.1C across the -20C to +50C temperature range.

To use the sensor, first set up an [I²C Bus](/components/i2c) and connect the sensor to the specified pins.

If accuracy is a must, see section 8.2.2.2 of the [datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tmp117.pdf).

```yaml
# Example configuration entry
sensor:
  - platform: tmp117
    name: "Living Room Temperature"
    update_interval: 60s
```

## Configuration variables

- **address** (*Optional*, int): The I²C address of the sensor.
  See [I²C Addresses](#tmp117_i2c_addresses) for more information.

- **update_interval** (*Optional*, [Time](/guides/configuration-types#time)): The interval to check the sensor. Defaults to `60s`. The sensor component sets the maximum possible averaging in the sensor based on this.
- All other options from [Sensor](/components/sensor).

## I²C Addresses

In order to allow multiple sensors to be connected to the same I²C bus,
the creators of this sensor hardware have included some options to
change the i²c address.

- If the address pin is pulled to GND, the address is `0x48` (Default).
- If the address pin is pulled to VCC, the address is `0x49`.
- If the address pin is tied to SDA, the address is `0x4A`.
- If the address pin is tied to SCL, the address is `0x4B`.
