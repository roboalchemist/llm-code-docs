This component exposes the different gas concentration sensors from the [MiCS-4514](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-2417.html). This is a differnet sensor than the MICS-4514 being sold on AliExpress.

> [!NOTE]
> The sensor has a 3-minute warmup period where data is unreliable and ESPHome will only start publishing sensor values after this time.
> If the sensor was already powered only, such as if you restarted or updated your ESPHome device, then it will start publishing immediately.
>
> The [I²C Bus](/components/i2c) is required to be set up in your configuration for this sensor to work.
