## Component/Hub

The `ads1115` domain creates a global hub so that you can later create
individual sensors using the [ADS1115 Sensor Platform](#ads1115-sensor).
To use this hub, first setup the [I²C Bus](/components/i2c) and connect the sensor to the pins specified there.

{{< img src="ads1115-full.jpg" alt="Image" caption="ADS1115 16-Bit ADC." width="50.0%" class="align-center" >}}

```yaml
ads1115:
  - address: 0x48
```

### Configuration variables

- **address** (**Required**, int): The i²c address of the sensor.
  See [I²C Addresses](#ads1115_i2c_addresses) for more information.

- **continuous_mode** (*Optional*, boolean): Set if the ADS1115 should continuously measure voltages or
  only measure them when an update is called. Please enable this for the {{< docref "ct_clamp/" >}} component.
  Defaults to `off`.

- **id** (*Optional*, [ID](/guides/configuration-types#id)): Manually specify the ID for this ADS1115 Hub. Use this if you
  want to use multiple ADS1115 hubs at once.

## I²C Addresses

In order to allow multiple sensors to be connected to the same i²c bus,
the creators of this sensor hardware have included some options to
change the i²c address.

- If the address pin is pulled to GND, the address is `0x48` (Default).
- If the address pin is pulled to VCC, the address is `0x49`.
- If the address pin is tied to SDA, the address is `0x4a`.
- If the address pin is tied to SCL, the address is `0x4B`.

## Sensor

The `ads1115` sensor allows you to use your ADS1115 sigma-delta ADC
sensors ([datasheet](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ads1115.pdf), `Adafruit_ADS1115`*) or your ADS1015 sigma-delta ADC sensors ([datasheet](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ads1015.pdf), `Adafruit_ADS1015`*) with ESPHome.
First, setup an [ADS1115 Hub](#ads1115-component) for your ADS1115 sensor and then use this
sensor platform to create individual sensors that will report the
voltage to Home Assistant.

```yaml
ads1115:
  - address: 0x48
sensor:
  - platform: ads1115
    multiplexer: 'A0_GND'
    gain: 6.144
    name: "ADS1115 Channel A0-GND"
```

### Configuration variables

- **multiplexer** (**Required**): The multiplexer channel of this sensor. Effectively means between which pins you
   want to measure voltage.

- **gain** (**Required**, float): The gain of this sensor.
- **sample_rate** (*Optional*, int): The sample rate of this sensor. Defaults to `860`.
- **ads1115_id** (*Optional*, [ID](/guides/configuration-types#id)): Manually specify the ID of the
   [ADS1115 Hub](#ads1115-component) you want to use this sensor.

- **update_interval** (*Optional*, [Time](/guides/configuration-types#time)): The interval
   to check the sensor. Defaults to `60s`.

- **resolution** (*Optional*, string): the resolution of this sensor. Defaults to `16 bits`.

- `16 bits`
- `12 bits`

- All other options from [Sensor](/components/sensor).

## Multiplexer, Gain and Sample rate

> [!NOTE]
> As per ([datasheet](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ads1115.pdf), [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1085)) Section 7.3 Note 2:
> "No more than VDD + 0.3V must be applied to the analog inputs of the device."
> This means if you power the device with 3.3V, take care not to supply the 4 AIN pins with more than 3.6V.

The ADS1115 has a multiplexer that can be configured to measure voltage between several pin configurations. These are:

- `A0_A1` (between Pin 0 and Pin 1)
- `A0_A3` (between Pin 0 and Pin 3)
- `A1_A3` (between Pin 1 and Pin 3)
- `A2_A3` (between Pin 2 and Pin 3)
- `A0_GND` (between Pin 0 and GND)
- `A1_GND` (between Pin 1 and GND)
- `A2_GND` (between Pin 2 and GND)
- `A3_GND` (between Pin 3 and GND)

The ADS1115 has a Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA) that can help you measure voltages in different ranges, these are:

- `6.144` (measures up to 6.144V)
- `4.096` (measures up to 4.096V)
- `2.048` (measures up to 2.048V)
- `1.024` (measures up to 1.024V)
- `0.512` (measures up to 0.512V)
- `0.256` (measures up to 0.256V)

Additionally, the sample rate can be adjusted to reduce noise. Note that low values will cause high loop delay. Supported values:

- `8` (8 SPS or 128 SPS on ADS1015)
- `16` (16 SPS or 250 SPS on ADS1015)
- `32` (32 SPS or 490 SPS on ADS1015)
- `64` (64 SPS or 920 SPS on ADS1015)
- `128` (128 SPS or 1600 SPS on ADS1015)
- `250` (250 SPS or 2400 SPS on ADS1015)
- `475` (475 SPS or 3300 SPS on ADS1015)
- `860` (860 SPS or 3300 SPS on ADS1015)

The ADS1115 can be used with defaults settings.
When using an ADS1015, the resolution has to be specified and should be defined to `12_BITS`
(or equivalent notations like `12 BITS` or `12 bits`  ).
