## Component/Hub

ADS1118 4-Channel 16-Bit A/D Converter ([datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ads1118.pdf))
The `ads1118` domain creates a global hub so that you can later create
individual sensors using the [ADS1118 Sensor Platform](#ads1118-sensor).
It uses the [SPI Bus](/components/spi) for communication.

{{< img src="ads1118-full.jpg" alt="Image" caption="ADS1118 16-Bit ADC." width="60.0%" class="align-center" >}}

```yaml
ads1118:
  cs_pin: GPIOXX
```

### Configuration variables

- **cs_pin** (**Required**, int): The SPI cable select pin to use.
- **id** (*Optional*, [ID](/guides/configuration-types#id)): Manually specify the ID for this ADS1118 Hub. Use this if you
  want to use multiple ADS1118 hubs at once.

## Sensor

The `ads1118` sensor allows you to use your ADS1118 delta-sigma ADC
sensors ([datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ads1118.pdf)) with ESPHome.
First, setup an [ADS1118 Hub](#ads1118-component) for your ADS1118 sensor and then use this
sensor platform to create individual sensors that will report the voltage.

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: ads1118
    type: adc
    id: batt_volt
    name: Battery Voltage
    multiplexer: A3_GND
    gain: 4.096
    update_interval: .01s
```

### Configuration variables

- **type** (*Optional*): `adc`  (default) or `temperature`
- **ads1118_id** (*Optional*, [ID](/guides/configuration-types#id)): Manually specify the ID of the
   [ADS1118 Hub](#ads1118-component) you want to use this sensor.

- **update_interval** (*Optional*, [Time](/guides/configuration-types#time)): The interval to check the sensor. Defaults to `60s`.
- All other options from [Sensor](/components/sensor).

#### ADC Options

- **multiplexer** (**Required**): The multiplexer channel of this sensor. Effectively means between which pins you want to measure voltage.
- **gain** (**Required**, float): The gain of this sensor.

#### Temperature Options

None

## Multiplexer and Gain

> [!NOTE]
> As per ([datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ads1118.pdf)) Section 7.3 Note 2:
> "No more than VDD + 0.3V must be applied to the analog inputs of the device."
> This means if you power the device with 3.3V, take care not to supply the 4 AIN pins with more than 3.6V.

The ADS1118 has a multiplexer that can be configured to measure voltage between several pin configurations. These are:

- `A0_A1` (between Pin 0 and Pin 1)
- `A0_A3` (between Pin 0 and Pin 3)
- `A1_A3` (between Pin 1 and Pin 3)
- `A2_A3` (between Pin 2 and Pin 3)
- `A0_GND` (between Pin 0 and GND)
- `A1_GND` (between Pin 1 and GND)
- `A2_GND` (between Pin 2 and GND)
- `A3_GND` (between Pin 3 and GND)

Additionally, the ADS1118 has a Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA) that can help you measure voltages in different ranges, these are:

- `6.144` (measures up to 6.144V)
- `4.096` (measures up to 4.096V)
- `2.048` (measures up to 2.048V)
- `1.024` (measures up to 1.024V)
- `0.512` (measures up to 0.512V)
- `0.256` (measures up to 0.256V)
