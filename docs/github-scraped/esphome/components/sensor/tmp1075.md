The TMP1075 Temperature sensor allows you to use your TMP1075
([datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/gpn/tmp1075))
sensors with ESPHome.

The TMP1075 is a high precision temperature sensor that communicates over I²C.
Each sensor is tested on a NIST tracable test setup during Texas Instruments'
production process. Accuracy is typically ±0.25°C across the -55°C to +125°C
range, with a maximum error of ±2°C in that same range and ±1°C in the -40°C to
+110°C range.

To use the sensor, first set up an [I²C Bus](/components/i2c) and connect the sensor
to the specified pins.

```yaml
# Example configuration entry
sensor:
  - platform: tmp1075
    name: "Temperature TMP1075"
    update_interval: 10s
    i2c_id: i2c_bus
    conversion_rate: 27.5ms
    alert:
      function: comparator
      polarity: active_high
      limit_low: 50
      limit_high: 75
      fault_count: 1
```

## Configuration variables

- **address** (*Optional*, int): The I²C address of the sensor.
  See [I²C Addresses](#tmp1075_i2c_addresses) for more information. Defaults to `0x48`.

- **update_interval** (*Optional*, [Time](/guides/configuration-types#time)): The interval to check
  the sensor temperature. Defaults to `60s`.

- **conversion_rate** (*Optional*): The interval at which the IC performs a
  temperature measurement. This setting also determines how fast the alert pin
  responds to temperature changes, and is thus independent of how often ESPHome
  checks the sensor. Possible values are `27.5ms`, `55ms`, `110ms`, and
  `220ms`. Defaults to `27.5ms`.

- **alert** (*Optional*): Configure the alert pin behaviour.

  - **function** (*Optional*, enum): Function of the alert pin, either `comparator` or `interrupt`. Defaults to `comparator`.
  - **polarity** (*Optional*, enum): Polarity of the alert pin, either `active_high` or `active_low`. Defaults to `active_high`.
  - **limit_low** (*Optional*, int): Lower temperature limit, in °C. Defaults to `-128` (the lowest possible limit value).
  - **limit_high** (*Optional*, int): Higher temperature limit, in °C. Defaults to `127.9375` (the highest possible limit value).
  - **fault_count** (*Optional*, int): Number of measurements. required for the alert pin to act. Must be between `1` and `4`, inclusive. Defaults to `1`.
- All other options from [Sensor](/components/sensor).

## I²C Addresses

In order to allow multiple sensors to be connected to the same I²C bus, the
creators of this sensor hardware have included some options to change the I²C
address. Three address pins can be connected to GND, VCC, SDA, or SCL, creating
32 possible addresses. See section 9.3.2.2 of the [datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/gpn/tmp1075) for the mapping table.

When all address pins are connected to GND, the address is `0x48`, which is
the default address for this sesnsor component.
