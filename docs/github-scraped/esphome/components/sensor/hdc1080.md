The HDC1080 Temperature+Humidity sensor allows you to use your HDC1080
([datasheet](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/hdc1080.pdf),
[Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2635)) sensors with
ESPHome. The [I²C Bus](/components/i2c) is
required to be set up in your configuration for this sensor to work.

```yaml
# Example configuration entry
sensor:
  - platform: hdc1080
    temperature:
      name: "Living Room Temperature"
    humidity:
      name: "Living Room Humidity"
    update_interval: 60s
```

## Configuration variables

- **temperature** (**Required**): The information for the temperature sensor.

  - All options from [Sensor](/components/sensor).

- **humidity** (**Required**): The information for the humidity sensor

  - All options from [Sensor](/components/sensor).

- **update_interval** (*Optional*, [Time](/guides/configuration-types#time)): The interval to check the sensor. Defaults to `60s`.

Currently, the platform doesn't support activating the built-in heater,
as it seems to only be rarely of use. If you need it, please open an
issue.

## Notes

This library also appears to the compatible with the [DFRobot CHT8305 I2C Temperature and Humidity Sensor](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/SKU_SEN0546_I2C_Temperature_and_Humidity_Sensor_Stainless_Steel_Shell)) on address 0x40.

```yaml
# Example configuration entry
sensor:
  - platform: hdc1080
    temperature:
      name: "Outside Temperature"
    humidity:
      name: "Outside Humidity"
    address: 0x40
    update_interval: 60s
```
