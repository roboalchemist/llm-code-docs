The `tm1621` display platform allows you to use the popular TM1621 LCD display drivers with ESPHome, that can find in Sonoff device like THR316D, THR320D, POWR316D or POWR320D

{{< img src="tm1621-full.jpg" alt="Image" caption="TM1621 LCD Display." width="75.0%" class="align-center" >}}

The LCD have four signal, `cs` for chip select, `data` for data signal, `read` for reading data dir and `write` for writing data dir

```yaml
# Example configuration entry
display:
  platform: tm1621
  id: tm1621_display
  cs_pin: GPIOXX
  data_pin: GPIOXX
  read_pin: GPIOXX
  write_pin: GPIOXX
  lambda: |-
    it.printf(0, "%.1f", id(my_sensor1).state);
    it.display_celsius(true);
    it.printf(1, "%.1f", id(my_sensor2).state);
    it.display_humidity(true);
```

## Configuration variables

- **cs_pin** (**Required**, [Pin Schema](/guides/configuration-types#pin-schema)): The pin you have the CS line.
- **data_pin** (**Required**, [Pin Schema](/guides/configuration-types#pin-schema)): The pin you have the DATA line.
- **read_pin** (**Required**, [Pin Schema](/guides/configuration-types#pin-schema)): The pin you have the READ line.
- **write_pin** (**Required**, [Pin Schema](/guides/configuration-types#pin-schema)): The pin you have the WRITE line.
- **lambda** (*Optional*, [lambda](/automations/templates#config-lambda)): The lambda to use for rendering the content on the TM1621.
  See [Rendering Lambda](#display-tm1621_lambda) for more information.

- **update_interval** (*Optional*, [Time](/guides/configuration-types#time)): The interval to re-draw the screen. Defaults to `1s`.
- **id** (*Optional*, [ID](/guides/configuration-types#id)): Manually specify the ID used for code generation.

## Rendering Lambda

The TM1621 has a similar API to the fully fledged [Display Rendering Engine](/components/display#display-engine), but it's only a subset as the TM1621
LCD displays don't have a concept of individual pixels. In the lambda you're passed a variable called `it`
as with all other displays. In this case however, `it` is a TM1621 instance (see API Reference).

The most basic operation with the TM1621 is wiring a simple number to the screen as in the configuration example
at the top of this page. But even though you're passing in a string (here `"0123"`  ), ESPHome converts it
into a representation that the TM1621 can understand.

Each of the three methods (`print` and `printf`  ) all optionally take a the line number (0 for first line and 1 for the second).
This argument is `0` by default.

Also note that the `.` (dot) character is special because when ESPHome encounters it in the string the dot
segment of the previous position will be enabled.

```yaml
display:
  - platform: tm1621
    # ...
  lambda: |-
    it.printf(0, "%.1f", id(my_sensor1).state);
    it.display_celsius(true);
    it.printf(1, "%.1f", id(my_sensor2).state);
    it.display_humidity(true);
```

Please see [Formatted Text](/components/display#display-printf) for a quick introduction into the `printf` formatting rules.

Also we have five function to display or not some unites:

- °C on the first line : `display_celsius(bool)`
- °F on the first line : `display_fahrenheit(bool)`
- %HR on the second line : `display_humidity(bool)`
- V on the first line and A on the second line : `display_voltage(bool)`
- kW/h on the first line and W on the second line : `display_kwh(bool)`
