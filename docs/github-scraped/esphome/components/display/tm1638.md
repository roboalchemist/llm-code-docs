The `tm1638` display platform allows you to use the popular TM1638 7 Segment Display Keypad & LED Module with ESPHome.

{{< img src="tm1638-full.jpg" alt="Image" caption="TM1638 8-Segment Display Keypad & LED Module." width="75.0%" class="align-center" >}}

The module can be powered with 5v DC. To display the colon punctuation use the
`.` in the colon place. (See clock example below)

```yaml
# Example configuration entry
display:
    platform: tm1638
    id: tm1638_display
    stb_pin: GPIOXX
    clk_pin: GPIOXX
    dio_pin: GPIOXX
    intensity: 5
    update_interval: 5s
    lambda: |-
      it.print("0123");
```

## Configuration variables

- **stb_pin** (**Required**, [Pin Schema](/guides/configuration-types#pin-schema)): The pin you have the STB line hooked up to.
- **clk_pin** (**Required**, [Pin Schema](/guides/configuration-types#pin-schema)): The pin you have the CLK line hooked up to.
- **dio_pin** (**Required**, [Pin Schema](/guides/configuration-types#pin-schema)): The pin you have the DIO line hooked up to.
- **intensity** (*Optional*, int): The intensity with which the TM1638 should drive the outputs. Range is from
  0 (least intense) to 7 (the default). This setting will affect the 7 segment display and the 8 individual LED lights.

- **lambda** (*Optional*, [lambda](/automations/templates#config-lambda)): The lambda to use for rendering the content on the TM1638.
  See [Rendering Lambda](#display-tm1638_lambda) for more information.

- **update_interval** (*Optional*, [Time](/guides/configuration-types#time)): The interval to re-draw the screen. Defaults to `1s`.
- **id** (*Optional*, [ID](/guides/configuration-types#id)): Manually specify the ID used for code generation.

## Rendering Lambda

The TM1638 has a similar API to the fully fledged [Display Rendering Engine](/components/display#display-engine), but it's only a subset as the TM1638
7-segment Display Keypad & LED Module does not have a concept of individual pixels. In the lambda you're passed a variable called `it`
as with all other displays. In this case however, `it` is a TM1638 instance (see API Reference).

The most basic operation with the TM1638 is writing a simple number to the screen as in the configuration example
at the top of this page. But even though you're passing in a string (here `"0123"`  ), ESPHome converts it
into a representation that the TM1638 can understand: The exact pixels that should be turned on. And of course,
not all characters can be represented. You can see a full list of characters [at the MAX7219 docs](/components/display/max7219#display-max7219_characters).

Each of the three methods (`print`, `printf` and `strftime`  ) all optionally take a position argument at the
beginning which can be used to print the text at a specific position. This argument is `0` by default which
means the first character of the first TM1638. For example to start the first character of your text at
the end of the TM1638, you would write `it.print(3, "0");`.

Also note that the `.` (dot) character is special because when ESPHome encounters it in the string the dot
segment of the previous position will be enabled.

```yaml
display:
  - platform: tm1638
    # ...
    lambda: |-
      // Print 0 at position 0 (left)
      it.print("0");
      // Result: "0   "

      // Print 1 at position 1 (second character)
      it.print(1, "1");
      // Result: "01  "

      // Let's write a sensor value (let's assume it's 42.1)
      it.printf(0, "%.1f", id(my_sensor).state);
      // Result: "42.1 " (the dot will appear on the "2" segment)

      // Overwrite the previous content with blank
      it.print("    ");
      // Print a right-padded sensor value with 0 digits after the decimal
      it.printf("S%3.0f", id(my_sensor).state);
      // Result: "S 42"

      // Print the current time
      it.strftime("%H.%M");
      // Result for 10:06:42 -> "10:06" on a display with : and "10.06" on a display with .
```

Please see [Formatted Text](/components/display#display-printf) for a quick introduction into the `printf` formatting rules and
[Displaying Time](/components/display#display-strftime) for an introduction into the `strftime` time formatting.

### Creating a digital clock

The following example creates a typical digital clock with the `:` colon flashing every second.

```yaml
time:
  - platform: homeassistant
    id: homeassistant_time

display:
  platform: tm1638
  clk_pin: GPIOXX
  dio_pin: GPIOXX
  stb_pin: GPIOXX
  update_interval: 500ms
  lambda: |-
      static int i = 0;
      i++;
      if ((i % 2) == 0)
        it.strftime("%H.%M", id(homeassistant_time).now());
      else
        it.strftime("%H%M", id(homeassistant_time).now());
```

## LEDs

The TM1638 7 Segment Display Keypad & LED Module has 8 LED lights across the top or middle of the display, depending on the board. These LEDs can be exposed as {{< docref "/components/switch/index" "switches" >}} or {{< docref "/components/output/index" "outputs" >}} with the led property set between 0 and 7. The board has the LEDs labelled 1-8, but the leds use zero based addressing. The LED labelled "1" is LED 0 in the configuration.

```yaml
switch:
  - platform: tm1638
    id: TM1638Led1
    led: 0

output:
  - platform: tm1638
    id: TM1638Led2
    led: 1
```

## Buttons

The TM1638 7 Segment Display Keypad & LED Module has 8 buttons across the top or middle of the display, depending on the board. These buttons are exposed as binary sensor components with the key property set between 0 and 7, They can be accessed via the binary sensor component configuration. As with the LEDs the buttons are labeled 1-8 on the board, but use zero based addressing. Therefore the button labelled "1" is key 0 in the configuration. See {{< docref "/components/binary_sensor" >}}

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: tm1638
    name: "TM1638 Button 1"
    id: TM1638Button1
    key: 0
    filters:
      - delayed_on: 10ms
    on_press:
     then:
        - switch.turn_on: TM1638Led1
    on_release:
     then:
        - switch.turn_off: TM1638Led1

  - platform: tm1638
    name: "TM1638 Button 2"
    id: TM1638Button2
    key: 1
    filters:
      - delayed_on: 10ms
    on_press:
     then:
        - output.turn_on: TM1638Led2
    on_release:
     then:
        - output.turn_off: TM1638Led2
```
