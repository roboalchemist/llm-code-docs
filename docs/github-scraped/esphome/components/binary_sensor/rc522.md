The `rc522` component allows you to use RC522 NFC/RFID controllers
([datasheet](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MFRC522.pdf), [Ali Express](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1260729519.html))
with ESPHome. ESPHome can read the UID from the tag. Every NFC/RFID tag has a unique "UID" value assigned at the time
of manufacture. Tags can be associated with binary sensors, making it easy to determine when a specific tag is present.
You can also use the tag information directly within ESPHome automations/lambdas. See [Setting Up Tags](#rc522-setting_up_tags) for
information on how to setup individual binary sensors using this component.

The RC522 IC supports SPI, I²C and UART communication protocols; ESPHome can use either SPI or I²C.

## Component/Hub

- If you have a module as shown in the image above, it can only be used in SPI mode
  ([unless hacked](https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=442750.0)) and you must define a [SPI bus](/components/spi)
  in your configuration with both the **miso_pin** and **mosi_pin** set.

- If you have a RC522 which communicates via I²C (as on the M5 Stack), you need to have an [I²C](/components/i2c) bus configured.

## Over SPI

The `rc522_spi` component allows you to use RC522 NFC/RFID controllers with ESPHome. This component is a global hub
that establishes the connection to the RC522 via [SPI](/components/spi). Using [RC522 binary sensors](#rc522-binary_sensor),
you can then create individual binary sensors that track if an NFC/RFID tag is currently detected by the RC522.

```yaml
spi:

rc522_spi:
  cs_pin: GPIOXX

binary_sensor:
  - platform: rc522
    uid: 74-10-37-94
    name: "RC522 RFID Tag"
```

### Configuration variables

- **cs_pin** (**Required**, [Pin Schema](/guides/configuration-types#pin-schema)): The pin on the ESP that the chip select line
  is connected to.

- **reset_pin** (*Optional*, [Pin Schema](/guides/configuration-types#pin-schema)): The pin connected to the RST line. Some tests
  shows the RC522 working okay without this.

- **update_interval** (*Optional*, [Time](/guides/configuration-types#time)): The duration of each scan on the RC522. This affects the
  duration that the individual binary sensors stay active when they're found.
  If a device is not found within this time window, it will be marked as not present. Defaults to `1s`.

- **spi_id** (*Optional*, [ID](/guides/configuration-types#id)): Manually specify the ID of the [SPI Component](/components/spi) if you want
  to use multiple SPI buses.

- **id** (*Optional*, [ID](/guides/configuration-types#id)): Manually specify the ID for this component.
- **on_tag** (*Optional*, [Automation](/automations)): An automation to perform when a tag is read. See
  [`on_tag` Trigger](#rc522-on_tag).

- **on_tag_removed** (*Optional*, [Automation](/automations)): An automation to perform after a tag is removed. See
  [`on_tag_removed` Trigger](#rc522-on_tag_removed).

## Over I²C

The `rc522_i2c` component allows you to use RC522 NFC/RFID controllers with ESPHome. This component is a global hub
that establishes the connection to the RC522 via [I²C](/components/i2c) (also available over SPI). Using the
[RC522 binary sensors](#rc522-binary_sensor) you can then create individual binary sensors that track if
an NFC/RFID tag is currently detected by the RC522.

```yaml
i2c:

rc522_i2c:

binary_sensor:
  - platform: rc522
    uid: 74-10-37-94
    name: "RC522 RFID Tag"
```

### Configuration variables

- **address** (*Optional*, int): Manually specify the I²C address of the sensor. Defaults to `0x28`.
- **reset_pin** (*Optional*, [Pin Schema](/guides/configuration-types#pin-schema)): The pin connected to the RST line. Some tests
  shows the RC522 working okay without this.

- **update_interval** (*Optional*, [Time](/guides/configuration-types#time)): The duration of each scan on the RC522. This affects the
  duration that the individual binary sensors stay active when they're found.
  If a device is not found within this time window, it will be marked as not present. Defaults to `1s`.

- **i2c_id** (*Optional*, [ID](/guides/configuration-types#id)): Manually specify the ID of the [I²C Component](/components/i2c) if you want
  to use multiple I²C buses.

- **id** (*Optional*, [ID](/guides/configuration-types#id)): Manually specify the ID for this component.
- **on_tag** (*Optional*, [Automation](/automations)): An automation to perform when a tag is read. See
  [`on_tag` Trigger](#rc522-on_tag).

- **on_tag_removed** (*Optional*, [Automation](/automations)): An automation to perform after a tag is removed. See
  [`on_tag_removed` Trigger](#rc522-on_tag_removed).

## Triggers

{{< anchor "rc522-on_tag" >}}

### `on_tag` Trigger

This automation will be triggered immediately after the RC522 identifies a tag.

The parameter `x` this trigger provides is of type `std::string` and is the tag UID in the format
`74-10-37-94`. The configuration below will for example publish the tag ID on the MQTT topic `rc522/tag`.

```yaml
rc522_spi: # or rc522_i2c
  # ...
  on_tag:
    then:
      - mqtt.publish:
          topic: rc522/tag
          payload: !lambda 'return x;'
```

A tag scanned event can also be sent to the Home Assistant tag component
using [`homeassistant.tag_scanned` Action](/components/api#api-homeassistant_tag_scanned_action).

```yaml
rc522_spi: # or rc522_i2c
  # ...
  on_tag:
    then:
      - homeassistant.tag_scanned: !lambda 'return x;'
```

{{< anchor "rc522-on_tag_removed" >}}

### `on_tag_removed` Trigger

This automation will be triggered when the RC522 no longer "sees" a previously scanned tag.

The parameter `x` this trigger provides is of type `std::string` and is the removed tag UID in the format
`74-10-37-94`. The example configuration below will publish the removed tag ID on the MQTT topic `pn7160/tag_removed`.

```yaml
rc522_spi: # or rc522_i2c
  # ...
  on_tag_removed:
    then:
      - mqtt.publish:
          topic: rc522/tag_removed
          payload: !lambda 'return x;'
```

{{< anchor "rc522-binary_sensor" >}}

## `rc522` Binary Sensor

The `rc522` binary sensor platform lets you track if an NFC/RFID tag with a given unique id (`uid`  ) is currently
being detected by the RC522 or not.

```yaml
# Example configuration entry
spi:
  clk_pin: D0
  miso_pin: D1
  mosi_pin: D2

rc522_spi: # or rc522_i2c
  cs_pin: D3
  update_interval: 1s

binary_sensor:
  - platform: rc522
    uid: 74-10-37-94
    name: "RC522 RFID Tag"
```

### Configuration variables

- **uid** (**Required**, string): The unique ID of the NFC/RFID tag. This is a hyphen-separated list
  of hexadecimal values. For example `74-10-37-94`.

- All other options from [Binary Sensor](/components/binary_sensor#config-binary_sensor).

{{< anchor "rc522-setting_up_tags" >}}

## Setting Up Tags

To set up binary sensors for specific NFC/RFID tags you first have to know their unique IDs. To obtain this
id, first set up a simple RC522 configuration without any binary sensors like above.

When your code is running and you approach the RC522 with an NFC/RFID Tag, you should see a message like this:

```log
Found new tag '74-10-37-94'
```

Then copy this id and create a `binary_sensor` entry as in the configuration example. Repeat this process for each tag.
