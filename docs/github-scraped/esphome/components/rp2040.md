This component contains platform-specific options for the RP2040 platform.

> [!NOTE]
> Support for all aspects of ESPHome on the RP2040 is still in development.
>
> Only the original model of Raspberry Pi Pico W board is supported, which has the Cypress **CYW43439** chip providing
> wireless connectivity. It can be identified by a metallic shield encapsulating the radio circuitry. Pico W boards with
> radio module chips like ESP8285 or similar (labelled as `RP2040 Pico W-2023` etc.), are not supported.
>
> Please search for or create an [issue](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/issues/new/choose) if you encounter an
> unknown problem.

```yaml
# Example configuration entry
rp2040:
  board: rpipicow
```

> [!NOTE]
> As of ESPHome 2024.9.2, the below `platform_version` is no longer required as ESPHome internally.
> Using the `platform_version` as is below is also known to cause compilation issues due to version mismatching.
>
> It is recommended to remove the `platform_version` from the configuration.

```yaml
# Example configuration entry
rp2040:
  board: rpipicow
  framework:
    platform_version: https://github.com/maxgerhardt/platform-raspberrypi.git
```

## Configuration variables

- **board** (*Optional*, string): The board type. Valid option is `rpipicow`.
- **watchdog_timeout** (*Optional*, string): The timeout to apply to the RP2040 watchdog (in seconds or milliseconds).
  When the device hangs for that period of time, it will reboot. Defaults to `8388ms` (maximum). Set to `0s` to
  disable the watchdog entirely.
