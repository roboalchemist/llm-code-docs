The `cst816` touchscreen platform allows using the touch screen controllers based on the CST816 series of chips with ESPHome.
The [I²C](/components/i2c) is required to be set up in your configuration for this touchscreen to work.

This controller is used in the Lilygo T-Display S3 AMOLED. The component should work with CST716, CST816D, CST816S,
CST816T, CST820, CST826, and CST836 controller chips.

## Base Touchscreen Configuration

```yaml
# Example configuration entry
touchscreen:
  platform: cst816
  id: my_touchscreen
  interrupt_pin: GPIOXX
  reset_pin: GPIOXX
```

### Configuration variables

- **id** (*Optional*, [ID](/guides/configuration-types#id)): Manually set the ID of this touchscreen.
- **interrupt_pin** (*Optional*, [Pin Schema](/guides/configuration-types#pin-schema)): The touch detection pin.
- **reset_pin** (*Optional*, [Pin Schema](/guides/configuration-types#pin-schema)): The chip reset pin.
- **skip_probe** (*Optional*, boolean): Skip reading the chip ID on startup. May be required for some variants (e.g. CST816S) that do not respond to i2c commands except after touches are registered. Defaults to false.

- All other options from [Touchscreen](/components/touchscreen#config-touchscreen).

## Binary Sensor

In addition to touch areas on the screen configured through the [Touchscreen](/components/touchscreen#config-touchscreen) component,
the cst816 can report touches on a dedicated button outside the display area. This can be utilised by configuring a [touchscreen binary sensor](/components/touchscreen#touchscreen_binary_sensor)
with the `use_raw` option and min/max values representing the sensor touch area.

### Sample config for the T-Display S3 AMOLED

```yaml
i2c:
  sda: GPIO3
  scl: GPIO2

touchscreen:
  - platform: cst816
    id: my_touchscreen
    interrupt_pin: GPIO21
```
