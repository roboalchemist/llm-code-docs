You first need to set up the {{< docref "/components/i2c" "I2C" >}} component.

```yaml
# Example configuration entry
time:
  - platform: rx8130
    id: rx8130_time
```

## Configuration variables

- **address** (*Optional*, int): Manually specify the I²C address of the RTC. Defaults to `0x32`.
- All other options from [Base Time Configuration](/components/time#base_time_config).

{{< anchor "rx8130-write_time_action" >}}

## `rx8130.write_time` Action

This [Action](/automations/actions#config-action) triggers a synchronization of the current system time to the RTC hardware.

> [!NOTE]
> The RX8130 component will *not* write to the RTC clock if not triggered *explicitly* by this action.

```yaml
on_...:
  - rx8130.write_time

  # in case you need to specify the RX8130 id
  - rx8130.write_time:
      id: rx8130_time
```

{{< anchor "rx8130-read_time_action" >}}

## `rx8130.read_time` Action

This [Action](/automations/actions#config-action) triggers a synchronization of the current system time from the RTC hardware.

> [!NOTE]
> The RX8130 component will automatically read the RTC clock every 15 minutes by default and synchronize the
> system clock when a valid timestamp is read from the RTC. (The `update_interval` can be changed.)
> This action can be used to trigger *additional* synchronizations.

```yaml
on_...:
  - rx8130.read_time

  # in case you need to specify the RX8130 id
  - rx8130.read_time:
      id: rx8130_time
```

{{< anchor "rx8130-config_example" >}}

## Full Configuration Example

In a typical setup, you will have at least one additional time source to synchronize the RTC with. Such an
external time source might not always be available e.g. due to a limited network connection.
In order to have a valid, reliable system time, the system should read the RTC once at start and then try to
synchronize with an external reliable time source.
When a synchronization to another time source was successful, the RTC can be resynchronized.

```yaml
esphome:
  on_boot:
    then:
      # read the RTC time once when the system boots
      rx8130.read_time:

time:
  - platform: rx8130
    # repeated synchronization is not necessary unless the external RTC
    # is much more accurate than the internal clock
    update_interval: never
    timezone: Europe/Paris
  - platform: homeassistant
    # instead try to synchronize via network repeatedly ...
    on_time_sync:
      then:
        # ... and update the RTC when the synchronization was successful
        rx8130.write_time:
```
