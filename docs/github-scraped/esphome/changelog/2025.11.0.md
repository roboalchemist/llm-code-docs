## Release Overview

<!-- RELEASE_OVERVIEW_START -->
ESPHome 2025.11.0 is a performance and reliability-focused release that makes your devices faster, more reliable, and more capable than ever before. WiFi connectivity gets a complete overhaul with intelligent mesh network handling, dramatically faster connection times, and enhanced security controls. Memory optimizations free up **2-31KB of RAM** and **10KB+ of flash**, giving even resource-constrained devices room to grow. A new infrastructure change slashes event processing latency by **600-1,300x**—making BLE Proxy GATT operations rival local Bluetooth adapters, even over the network.

**WiFi improvements** address the most common connectivity pain points: devices no longer get stuck on failed access points in mesh networks, hidden network connections are 2-6 seconds faster, and the new `min_auth_mode` option provides security controls with WPA2 defaults. The redesigned connection strategy with intelligent AP selection and reliable reconnection logic delivers the rock-solid WiFi performance users expect.

**Ultra-low latency event processing** transforms responsiveness across BLE, USB, MQTT, ESP-NOW, and wake word detection—reducing latency from 0-16ms to just ~12 microseconds. Voice assistants respond faster to wake words, BLE devices pair quicker, and MQTT automations trigger with sub-millisecond precision. This zero-configuration optimization automatically benefits all affected components on ESP32 platforms.

**Memory optimizations** touch nearly every core component—WiFi scan management, select options, lights, climate controls, sensors, and the action framework. Sensor filter optimizations deliver the most dramatic gains, with sliding window filters saving up to 25KB of RAM on configurations that previously struggled with memory constraints. These improvements enable more complex configurations on the same hardware.

New hardware support expands ESPHome's reach with 7 new components including the HDC2010 sensor, MCP3221 ADC, HLK-FM22X face recognition module, BH1900NUX sensor, RX8130 RTC, and TinyUSB foundation support for ESP32-S2/S3. Platform enhancements bring I2C and BLE logging to nRF52, while ESP32 gains hosted BLE for chips without native Bluetooth and ESP-NOW transport capabilities.

<!-- FEATURE_HIGHLIGHTS_START -->
## Enhanced WiFi Security and Reliability

**Dramatically Improved WiFi Reliability and Connection Times** ([#11805](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11805))

A major step forward in WiFi reliability addresses critical connectivity issues in mesh networks and multi-AP environments. Previously, devices would get stuck repeatedly trying the strongest signal even when that access point was rejecting connections—a bug introduced in 2025.8.2 that made the priority-based failover system ineffective.

The redesigned connection strategy delivers measurable improvements:

- **Intelligent AP selection**: Connection failure history now takes precedence over signal strength, enabling automatic failover to working access points instead of getting stuck on failed BSSIDs
- **Faster initial connections**: Explicit hidden network probing phase with smart skipping of visible networks reduces connection time by 2-6 seconds
- **Reliable reconnections**: Two-attempt BSSID filtering eliminates false positives from normal WiFi stack transitions
- **Natural mesh handling**: Simplified architecture removes 150+ lines of complex BSSID cycling logic—the priority degradation system now naturally handles mesh networks through scan-based retry cycles
- **Clearer diagnostics**: State machine-based retry phases with improved logging make connection issues easier to troubleshoot
- **Memory efficiency**: Automatic priority reset when all BSSIDs fail equally (saves up to 96 bytes)

This release restores and improves upon the reliable failover behavior users expect in multi-AP deployments, while reducing connection latency and memory overhead.

**Configurable Minimum Authentication Mode** ([#11814](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11814))

Added `min_auth_mode` configuration option to control WiFi authentication security:

- **Secure default**: WPA2 minimum authentication mode protects against downgrade attacks
- **Explicit security control**: Choose between WPA, WPA2, or WPA3 (ESP32 only)
- **Backward compatibility**: Can be lowered to WPA for legacy routers

```yaml
wifi:
  ssid: "MyNetwork"
  password: "password123"
  min_auth_mode: WPA2  # Recommended for security
```

## Memory Optimizations for Resource-Constrained Devices

ESPHome 2025.11.0 delivers substantial memory improvements across the entire framework, with measured savings ranging from **2-7KB of RAM on typical devices** and up to **31KB of RAM on sensor-heavy configurations**. Flash savings reach **10KB+** on ESP32/ESP8266 platforms.

- **Select component** ([#11514](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11514)) - Saves **270-2,800 bytes per select** depending on option count
- **Light component** ([#11348](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11348)) - Saves **1,756 bytes flash** on ESP8266, **~108 bytes RAM** per 6 lights
- **Climate component** ([#11466](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11466), [#11621](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11621)) - Saves **~440 bytes RAM** per climate entity
- **Fan component** ([#11483](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11483), [#11632](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11632)) - Saves **~24 bytes per fan**
- **Event component** ([#11463](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11463), [#11767](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11767)) - Saves **1,248 bytes flash**
- **Global Controller Registry** ([#11772](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11772)) - Saves **388-6,148 bytes RAM** depending on entity count
- **Action framework** ([#11704](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11704)) - Saves **356 bytes flash**, eliminates RAM allocations in automations
- **Script component** ([#11308](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11308)) - Saves **1,592 bytes flash** on ESP32
- **ESP32-IDF** ([#10930](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/10930), [#11441](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11441)) - Saves **~10KB combined** (1.3KB + 8.7KB)
- **Network component** ([#11707](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11707)) - Saves **32-72 bytes per network component**
- **Light effects** ([#11487](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11487)) - Saves **24-32 bytes per effect**
- **WiFi priority** ([#11830](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11830)) - Saves **3 bytes per network entry** plus up to **96 bytes** from auto-recovery

**Note on Breaking Changes:** These optimizations required API changes for external component developers. See [Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes) section for migration details. Standard YAML configurations remain fully compatible but custom code in lambdas may require updates.

## Ultra-Low Latency Event Processing

**Thread-Safe Loop Wake Mechanism** ([#11681](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11681))

A new infrastructure change eliminates event processing delays across multiple components. Previously, events from background tasks (BLE, USB, MQTT, ESP-NOW, wake word detection) would queue and wait up to 16ms for the next `select()` timeout before processing. The new `wake_loop_threadsafe()` mechanism uses a UDP loopback socket to immediately wake the main event loop when events arrive.

**Latency Improvements:**

- **Before**: 0-16ms average ~8ms
- **After**: ~12 microseconds
- **Speedup**: 600-1,300x faster event processing

**Components with Ultra-Low Latency:**

- **BLE operations** ([#11663](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11663)) - Bluetooth Proxy, BLE Client GATT operations, HomeKit pairing
- **USB Host** ([#11683](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11683)) - USB event processing over 1000x faster
- **MQTT** ([#11695](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11695)) - ESP32 only (ESP8266 already runs in main loop)
- **ESP-NOW** ([#11696](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11696)) - Packet reception and transmission completion
- **Micro Wake Word** ([#11698](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11698)) - Near-instant automation responses, all triggers fire within same millisecond

**Real-World Impact:**

- **BLE Proxy GATT operations** now rival or exceed BlueZ local adapters in Home Assistant, even when operating over the network
- Faster wake word detection response for voice assistants
- Improved BLE connection and pairing times
- Reduced MQTT automation trigger latency
- Faster USB event handling (e.g., Z-Wave PoE proxies)

This optimization requires no configuration changes and automatically benefits all affected components on ESP32 platforms.

## High-Performance Networking for Media Streaming

**Automatic Network Performance Tuning** ([#11812](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11812))

Introduced centralized high-performance networking system where components request optimized settings through `network.require_high_performance_networking()`:

- **PSRAM-aware configuration**: Aggressive settings (512KB TCP windows) when PSRAM guaranteed, conservative (65KB windows) otherwise
- **WiFi optimization**: Automatically applies optimized WiFi driver settings when high-performance mode enabled
- **Automatic enablement**: Speaker media player automatically enables high-performance networking (fixes streaming stuttering issues)
- **User control**: New `network.enable_high_performance` option to explicitly enable/disable

This optimization is critical for ESP32-S3 devices running voice assistants and media streaming, eliminating audio stuttering caused by insufficient WiFi buffer sizes.

**PSRAM Configuration Options** ([#11411](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11411))

Added `ignore_not_found` option (default `true`) to allow disabling `CONFIG_SPIRAM_IGNORE_NOTFOUND`. When set to `false` on devices with guaranteed PSRAM, enables WiFi driver to configure larger buffers for optimal streaming performance. Also improves boot reliability by managing heap allocations before PSRAM initialization.

- **Xiao BLE Bootloader Fix** ([#10698](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/10698)) - Corrected default bootloader, fixed upload, added runtime mismatch detection

## LVGL Display Enhancements

**Simplified Layout System** ([#10149](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/10149))

LVGL widgets now support shorthand layout methods for easier configuration:

```yaml
lvgl:
  widgets:
    - container:
        layout: vertical  # Simple flex layout
        widgets:
          - label:
              text: "Item 1"
          - label:
              text: "Item 2"

    - container:
        layout: 3x2  # Simple grid layout
```

New `container` widget provides styling-free base with 100% default dimensions. Added `stretch` option for flex layouts and substantial speedup of config validation.

**Rendering Triggers and NaN Substitution** ([#11628](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11628), [#11712](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11712))

Added `on_draw_start` and `on_draw_end` triggers for coordinating e-paper display updates. Text formatting now supports NaN substitution for graceful handling of unavailable sensor values:

```yaml
lvgl:
  widgets:
    - label:
        text:
          format: "%.1f°C"
          args: [id(temp_sensor)]

Major improvements to e-paper displays:

- **Faster transfers**: Larger data blocks for Spectra displays
- **Optimized state machine**: Code-based sequence instead of linear queue saves memory
- **Board-specific configs**: Pre-configured pin mappings (Seeed-reTerminal-E1002)
- **Improved timing**: Internal delay handling instead of loop disabling
- **Fixed busy pin logic** ([#11349](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11349)): Corrected active-low detection

**Component Idle Detection** ([#11651](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11651))

New `component.is_idle` condition and `is_idle()` method for automations that need to wait for displays to finish updating before proceeding:

```yaml
lvgl:
  on_draw_end:
    - component.update: epaper_display
    - wait_until:
        component.is_idle: epaper_display  # Wait for display ready
    - lvgl.resume:
```

## Configuration and Developer Tools

**Advanced Substitution Features** ([#11203](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11203))

The `!extend` and `!remove` tags now support substitutions and Jinja templates:

```yaml
substitutions:
  COMPONENT_TO_REMOVE: component3

packages:
  base:
    - id: !remove ${COMPONENT_TO_REMOVE}  # Conditional removal
```

**Memory Analysis Command** ([#11395](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11395))

```

**Sensor Heartbeat Filter Options** ([#10993](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/10993))

Heartbeat filter adds `optimistic` mode to forward new values immediately while still repeating periodically:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: template
    filters:
      - heartbeat:
          period: 100ms
          optimistic: true  # Forward immediately + repeat
```

## Breaking Changes

<!-- BREAKING_CHANGES_USERS_START -->

### User-Facing Breaking Changes

#### WiFi & Network

- **WiFi**: WiFi and Ethernet components no longer block other components' setup until connected. Components with setup priority > WIFI (802.3) now initialize immediately, even if network is disconnected. [#9823](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/9823)

- **WiFi min_auth_mode**: ESP8266 default will change from `WPA` to `WPA2` in 2026.6.0. Users with WPA-only routers must explicitly set `min_auth_mode: WPA` before then. [#11814](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11814)

- **WiFi priority**: The `priority` configuration option now only accepts integers (-128 to 127) instead of floats. Change `priority: 5.5` to `priority: 5`. [#11830](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11830)

- **.local addresses**: .local addresses now require mDNS to be enabled for DNS resolution. Previously attempted DNS resolution could add 10+ second delays. [#11508](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11508)

- **Network high performance**: Speaker media player now always enables high performance networking mode (previously only with codec support). Users can override with `enable_high_performance` under the network component if needed. [#11812](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11812)

### ESP32 Platform

- **ESP32 brownout protection**: ESP-IDF now reduces PHY TX power during brownout to prevent boot loops. Can be disabled with `sdkconfig_options: CONFIG_ESP_PHY_REDUCE_TX_POWER: n` if needed. [#11306](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11306)

- **ESP32 PSRAM**: PSRAM is no longer auto-loaded by components that depend on it (such as `esp32_camera`, `speaker`, and `media_player`). Users must now explicitly add a `psram:` configuration block to their YAML. Additionally, for ESP32-S3, the `mode` option is now required since S3 supports both quad and octal modes. Typically, 2MB PSRAM uses `quad` mode while 8 or 16MB uses `octal` mode—check your module's datasheet. Example configuration:

  ```yaml
  psram:
    mode: octal  # Required for ESP32-S3, use 'quad' or 'octal'
    speed: 80MHz
  ```

  [#11470](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11470)

### Component Behavior Changes

- **Script max_runs**: Queued scripts now default to `max_runs: 5` (allowing 1 running + 4 queued instances) instead of unlimited to prevent crashes from unbounded memory growth. Set `max_runs` explicitly if you need more capacity. [#11308](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11308)

- **Remote transmitter**: Remote transmitter now defaults to non-blocking mode to prevent long blocking operations (>30ms). [#11524](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11524)

- **Fan preset modes**: Fan preset modes now preserve the order defined in YAML instead of being sorted alphabetically. The order in Home Assistant will match your YAML configuration order. [#11483](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11483)

- **Select state**: The public `state` member has been deprecated and will be removed in 2026.5.0. Use `current_option()` method instead. Deprecation warnings will be shown during compilation. [#11623](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11623)

### Component-Specific Changes

- **HM3301**: AQI calculation updated to EPA 2024 standard. Values will change compared to the old 2012 formula. [#9442](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/9442)

- **GDK101**: Firmware version is now reported as a string instead of a float division result. [#11029](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11029)

- **Uponor Smatrix**: The `address` property of the `uponor_smatrix` component was removed. Device addresses are now 32-bit instead of separate 16-bit system and device addresses. Update configurations by prepending the previous system address to individual device addresses. [#11066](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11066)

- **Pipsolar**: Fixed typo `warnung_low_pv_energy` renamed to `warning_low_pv_energy`. Update YAML configurations. [#10291](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/10291)

- **E-Paper SPI**: Busy pin logic corrected to match datasheet (active low). Some e-paper displays may behave differently. [#11349](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11349)

- **nRF52 bootloader**: Default bootloader changed for `xiao_ble` and `adafruit_itsybitsy_nrf52840` boards. Warning shown if generic Adafruit bootloader is used. [#10698](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/10698)

- **HTTP request triggers**: Changed from multiple on_response/on_error triggers to a single trigger that receives variables. Update automation configurations to use the new variable-based trigger format. [#11464](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11464)

## YAML Lambda Changes

Users who access component members directly in YAML lambdas may need updates:

- **Select**: Change `id(my_select).state` to `id(my_select).current_option()` (deprecated, will be removed in 2026.5.0). [#11623](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11623)

- **Fan**: Change `id(my_fan).preset_mode` to `id(my_fan).get_preset_mode()`. [#11632](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11632)

- **Event**: Change `id(my_event).last_event_type` to `id(my_event).get_last_event_type()`. [#11767](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11767)

- **Climate**: Custom mode members are now private. Change direct access to public accessor methods:
  - Check if active: `id(my_climate).custom_fan_mode.has_value()` → `id(my_climate).has_custom_fan_mode()`, `id(my_climate).custom_preset.has_value()` → `id(my_climate).has_custom_preset()`
  - Get value: `id(my_climate).custom_fan_mode.value()` → `id(my_climate).get_custom_fan_mode()`, `id(my_climate).custom_preset.value()` → `id(my_climate).get_custom_preset()`

### Breaking Changes for Developers

<!-- BREAKING_CHANGES_DEVELOPERS_START -->

The following changes affect external component developers. Standard YAML configurations are generally not affected.

## Core Framework Changes

- **Action/Trigger Framework**: All action/trigger/condition method signatures changed to use const references (`const Ts&... x`) instead of pass-by-value (`Ts... x`). See the [Action Framework Performance Optimization](https://developers.esphome.io/blog/2025/11/06/action-framework-performance-optimization/) blog post for migration details. [#11704](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11704)

- **Controller API**: Controllers now use global registry pattern. Method signatures changed to remove unused state parameters (e.g., `on_sensor_update(sensor::Sensor *obj)` instead of `on_sensor_update(sensor::Sensor *obj, float state)`). External controller implementations extremely rare. [#11772](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11772)

- **EntityBase::hash_base()**: Removed deprecated virtual method (deprecated since June 2022). Remove `hash_base()` overrides from external components. [#11783](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11783)

- **hexencode()**: Removed function deprecated since 2022.1. Use alternative encoding methods. [#11383](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11383)

- **Schema constants**: Removed deprecated schema constants from core. Update external components to use current schema helpers. [#11591](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11591)

## Component-Specific API Changes

### Climate

See the [Climate Entity Class: FiniteSetMask and Flash Storage Optimizations](https://developers.esphome.io/blog/2025/11/07/climate-entity-class-finitesetmask-and-flash-storage-optimizations/) blog post for migration details.

- **Custom modes storage**: Changed from `std::set<std::string>` to `FiniteSetMask` for supported modes, and from `std::vector<std::string>` to `std::vector<const char *>` for custom fan modes and presets. [#11466](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11466), [#11621](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11621)

- **Member access**: Climate device members (`custom_fan_mode_`, `custom_preset_`) are now private. Use protected setter methods (`set_custom_fan_mode_()`, `set_custom_preset_()`) in derived classes. Use public accessor methods to read values: `has_custom_fan_mode()`, `get_custom_fan_mode()`, `has_custom_preset()`, `get_custom_preset()`. [#11621](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11621)

- **Deprecated methods**: Removed methods deprecated in 1.20 (July 2021). [#11388](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11388)

### Light

See the [Light Entity Class: Memory Optimizations](https://developers.esphome.io/blog/2025/11/07/light-entity-class-memory-optimizations/) blog post for migration details.

- **Color modes**: Replaced `std::set<ColorMode>` with `ColorModeMask` bitmask class. [#11348](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11348)

- **Effect names**: Changed from `std::string` to `const char *` for effect names. [#11487](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11487)

- **Deprecated methods**: Removed methods deprecated in 2021.8.0. [#11389](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11389)

### Fan

See the [Fan Entity Class: Preset Mode Flash Storage and Order Preservation](https://developers.esphome.io/blog/2025/11/07/fan-entity-class-preset-mode-flash-storage-and-order-preservation/) blog post for migration details.

- **Preset modes**: Changed from `std::set<std::string>` to `std::vector<const char *>`. The `.preset_mode` public member has been removed - use `get_preset_mode()` for reading and `set_preset_mode_()` for writing in derived classes. [#11483](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11483), [#11632](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11632)

- **Deprecated code**: Removed code deprecated in 2022.2. [#11392](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11392)

### Select

See the [Select Entity Class: Index-Based Operations and Flash Storage](https://developers.esphome.io/blog/2025/11/07/select-entity-class-index-based-operations-and-flash-storage/) blog post for migration details.

- **Options storage**: Changed from `std::vector<std::string>` to `FixedVector<const char *>`. [#11514](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11514)

- **State member**: Public `state` member deprecated (will be removed in 2026.5.0). Use `current_option()` method instead. [#11623](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11623)

- **Index-based operations**: Added optional `control(size_t index)` override for more efficient implementations. [#11623](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11623)

### Event

See the [Event Entity Class: Memory Optimizations](https://developers.esphome.io/blog/2025/11/07/event-entity-class-memory-optimizations/) blog post for migration details.

- **Event types storage**: Changed from `FixedVector<std::string>` to `FixedVector<const char *>`. The `last_event_type` field is now private - use `get_last_event_type()` getter instead. [#11463](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11463), [#11767](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11767)

### Network Components

See the [Network get_use_address() Optimization](https://developers.esphome.io/blog/2025/11/20/network-use-address-optimization/) blog post for migration details.

- **WiFi scan results**: External components that access WiFi scan results after connection must call `wifi.request_wifi_scan_results()` in their `to_code()` function to prevent cleanup. [#11205](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11205)

- **use_address**: Changed from `const std::string &` to `const char *` in WiFi, Ethernet, and OpenThread components. Remove `.c_str()` calls when using `get_use_address()`. [#11707](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11707)

### Other Components

- **Cover**: Removed methods deprecated in 2021.9. Update to current cover API. [#11391](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11391)

- **Nextion**: Removed methods deprecated in 1.20 (July 2021). Update to current nextion API. [#11393](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11393)

## ESP32-Specific Changes

- **ESP-IDF advanced options**: New options to disable libc locks in IRAM and VFS features. External components using these features must call helper functions to register needs. [#10930](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/10930), [#11441](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/11441)
