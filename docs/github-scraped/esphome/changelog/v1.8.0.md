Hi everyone,

Today I have a new version of esphomelib with lots of new features and tons of time put in to present to you and
I hope you're as excited as I am to try these new things out :)

This release mainly focuses on these new features:

- Lots of Bug Fixes - Now that most of the hardware has arrived from china, I was able to fix a bunch
  of bugs with a lot of integrations.

- {{< docref "/components/display/index" "Displays!" >}}
- NFC/RFID Readers ({{< docref "/components/binary_sensor/pn532" "PN532" >}} and {{< docref "/components/binary_sensor/rdm6300" "RDM6300" >}})
- New {{< docref "/components/esp32_ble_tracker" "ESP32 BLE integrations" >}} like {{< docref "/components/sensor/xiaomi_hhccjcy01" "Xiaomi HHCCJCY01" >}}
- Core Changes like the addition of the [SPI bus](/components/spi) and [UART bus](/components/uart)
- Lots of new [light effects](/components/light#light-effects) and support for cold-white/warm-white lights.
- A LOGO FOR THIS PROJECT!!! Thanks a lot to [@messimore](https://github.com/messismore) for
  this visual masterpiece.

And if you find esphomelib great and have some of your projects using it, please do spread the word online
(like [Christoph Dahlen did](https://www.dahlen.org/2018/08/esp8266-via-esphomelib-mit-home-assistant-verbinden/))
and/or create [cookbook](/components#cookbook) entries so that others can learn from your work. Of course the main objective
of this website is to document esphomelib's features, but my vision is that it also inspires others to start
awesome projects ☀️

And in some more personal news, you might have noticed that I was not very active in online communications (github, discord, ...)
and that's partly been due to me concentrating on other stuff (university applications, work and
[this year's international olympiad of informatics](http://blog.ocg.at/2018/09/dritter-blog-von-der-ioi-in-tsukuba-japan/)).
But admittedly I must say being constantly active online is just very exhausting. As the next few weeks (or even months)
will leave me with little time to due to the start of my studies, I plan on primarily focusing on GitHub communications.
Plus I want to put an extra focus on reviewing PRs so that code submitters don't have to wait for weeks.

## Other notable changes

- Fixed certain occasions where esphomeyaml could run into recursive dependencies
- Fixed i2c scans not showing up via MQTT
- Improved build times by about 60%. Now, the build time should depend on the amount of components you're using,
  not the total esphomelib code base size.

- Fixed ESP32 Touch setup mode
- Fixed template binary sensors
- Added the option to specify `never` for `update_interval` to never
- Added `deep_sleep.prevent` and `deep_sleep.enter` actions
- Fixed ESP32BLETracker surpassing the maximum code size
- Fixed ESP32BLETracker/Beacon throwing an exception when a warning occurs.
- Fixed FastLED effects not taking into account the light brightness
- Fixed compatibility with Arduino core versions below 2.0.4
- Added `output.turn_on`, `output.turn_off` and `output.set_level` actions.
- Fixed the remote transmitter/receiver using the heap inefficiently on the ESP8266 (was causing reboots)
- Fixed reliability with reading data from BME280s
- Fixed gas resistance readings from BME680s
- Fixed HTU21D readings only working in very verbose mode
- Sometimes the ESP would create a WiFi hotspot even though it was not configured to do so. That should be fixed now.
- You can now also have conditional actions. See [`if` Action](/automations/actions#if_action).
- The esphomeyaml dashboard and Hass.io add-on now can be configured with a password.
- Fixed YAML anchors not working (you can now prefix keys with `.` to make esphomeyaml ignore them)
- Made Dallas and DHT temperature sensor a bit more reliable by making the code a bit more efficient and thus resolving some timing issues.
- A `heartbeat` filter has been added to [binary sensors](/components/binary_sensor#binary_sensor-filters).
- The [`on_loop`](/components/esphome#esphome-on_loop) trigger has been added.
- esphomeyaml now know about more ESP8266/ESP32 boards, so now you can use the board-specific pin
  names with even more board types.

- The mqtt client has a new option `shutdown_message` which will be sent when the board shuts down safely.

- In actions, instead of

```yaml
    on_...:
      then:
        - switch.turn_on:
            id: my_switch
```

  You can now write:

```yaml
    on_...:
      then:
        - switch.turn_on: my_switch
```

  Or even shorter:

```yaml
    on_...:
      - switch.turn_on: my_switch
```

## Breaking Changes

- The {{< docref "/components/esphome" "core configuration" >}} has been reworked a bit to a)
  make using different arduino framework version easier and b) make editing your local esphomelib
  copy easier.

- Light Effects now need to be manually declared in the config and will no longer show up automatically. Please see [Light Effects](/components/light#light-effects)
- MAX6675 has been migrated to use the new SPI bus (and fixed!). Please see the docs for how to use it now.
