## Release Overview

ESPHome 2025.7.0 is a major release featuring significant architectural improvements, new hardware support,
and important platform updates. This release modernizes the codebase while expanding hardware compatibility
and introducing powerful new features for advanced users.

**Major Changes:**

- **Web Server OTA** moved to dedicated platform (breaking change - migration required)
- **ESP-IDF 4.x support removed** - ESP-IDF 5.3.2+ now required
- **ESP32 Arduino updated to 3.1.3** for better compatibility and performance
- **Sub-device support** for logical entity grouping in Home Assistant
- **Jinja2 template expressions** for dynamic configuration generation

**New Hardware:**

- LoRa communication (SX126x/SX127x), ESP32 Hosted WiFi, LN882X SoCs
- New sensors: OPT3001 light, LPS22 pressure, GL-R01 ToF, Xiaomi BLE

**Performance:**

- Extensive memory optimizations (up to 40% reduction in component memory usage)
- Enhanced performance through C++20 support and optimized algorithms
- Improved interrupt handling and scheduler efficiency

## Web Server OTA Platform

> [!WARNING]
> **Breaking Change:** Read this carefully! If your only OTA method is `web_server` and you don't have it explicitly
> enabled, you will lose the ability to update devices OTA after updating to 2025.7.0. You must add the `web_server`
> OTA platform to your configuration to maintain OTA functionality.

The {{< docref "/components/web_server" >}} component has undergone a significant architectural change. Previously,
OTA functionality was built directly into the web server component. This has now been extracted into a dedicated
OTA platform: {{< docref "/components/ota/web_server" >}}.

**Migration Required:**

If you were relying on the web server's built-in OTA functionality, you now need to explicitly configure the web
server OTA platform:

```yaml
# Before (implicit OTA in web server)
web_server:
  port: 80

# After (explicit OTA platform required)
web_server:
  port: 80

ota:
  - platform: esphome  # Your existing OTA method
  - platform: web_server  # Add this for web-based OTA uploads
```

**Benefits of this change:**

- **Cleaner separation of concerns** - Web server focuses on serving content, OTA platform handles updates
- **More flexible OTA configuration** - Better control over OTA methods and security
- **Improved maintainability** - Dedicated OTA platform allows for better features and bug fixes

## ESP-IDF 4.x End of Life

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Major Platform Change:** This release completely removes support for ESP-IDF 4.x versions, marking the end of life
> for these older framework versions.

ESPHome 2025.7.0 removes all support for ESP-IDF 4.x versions as part of our commitment to supporting modern,
secure, and well-maintained development frameworks. Please see our
[developer blog post](https://developers.esphome.io/blog/2025/06/18/sunsetting-support-for-idf-4x/) for detailed
background and technical reasons behind this decision.

**What this means for users:**

- **Most users are unaffected** - We automatically set the recommended ESP-IDF version (currently 5.3.2) as the default
- **Explicit version users must update** - If you're explicitly setting the ESP-IDF version in your configuration,
  you must update to version 5.3.2 or later

- **Legacy projects may need updates** - Older projects might require minor configuration adjustments

**Required action if you explicitly set ESP-IDF version:**

```yaml
# Remove or update old explicit versions
esp32:
  board: esp32dev
  framework:
    type: esp-idf
    version: 4.4.7  # ❌ No longer supported

# Update to supported version
esp32:
  board: esp32dev
  framework:
    type: esp-idf
    version: 5.3.2  # ✅ Supported (or omit for latest recommended)
```

**Benefits of ESP-IDF 5.x:**

- **Enhanced security** - Latest security patches and improvements
- **Better performance** - Optimized code generation and runtime performance
- **Modern C++ support** - Full C++20 support with improved standard library
- **Expanded hardware support** - Better support for newer ESP32 variants (S2, S3, C3, C6, H2)
- **Active maintenance** - Continued updates and bug fixes from Espressif

## ESP32 Arduino Framework 3.x

> [!NOTE]
> **Framework Update:** Arduino for ESP32 has been upgraded to version 3.1.3, bringing significant improvements
> and maintaining compatibility with ESP-IDF 5.3.2.

To maintain alignment and compatibility with the current ESP-IDF version of 5.3.2, the Arduino framework for ESP32
has been updated to version 3.1.3. This represents a major version jump from Arduino 2.x.

**Key improvements in Arduino 3.1.3:**

- **ESP-IDF 5.3.2 compatibility** - Full integration with the latest ESP-IDF features
- **Improved stability** - Better memory management and reduced crashes
- **Enhanced WiFi performance** - More reliable connections and better power management
- **Updated libraries** - Latest versions of core Arduino libraries
- **Bug fixes** - Numerous fixes for issues present in earlier versions

**Potential compatibility considerations:**

- Some third-party Arduino libraries may need updates for Arduino 3.x compatibility
- Timing-sensitive code might behave slightly differently due to framework optimizations
- Memory usage patterns may change slightly due to framework improvements

> [!NOTE]
> **Flash Usage Warning:** Arduino 3.x can use more flash memory than Arduino 2.x, which may cause some projects
> with many components to exceed available flash space. If you encounter flash size issues, consider:
>
> - Switching to ESP-IDF framework (recommended for large projects)
> - Reducing the number of enabled components
> - Using a board with more flash memory

Most users will see this as a transparent improvement with better performance and reliability.

## Sub-Device Support

> [!NOTE]
> **New Feature:** Entities can now be organized into logical sub-devices, enabling better organization
> and area management in Home Assistant.

ESPHome now supports **sub-devices**, a powerful new feature that allows you to logically group entities from a single
physical ESPHome device into multiple virtual devices within Home Assistant. This is particularly useful for complex
setups where one ESP32 controls sensors or actuators in different areas of your home.

**Use cases and benefits:**

- **Multi-room sensors** - One ESP32 with temperature sensors in different rooms can appear as separate devices per room
- **Complex automation hubs** - A single ESP32 controlling lights, fans, and sensors across multiple areas
- **Better Home Assistant organization** - Entities automatically appear in the correct areas and can be managed
  independently

- **Cleaner dashboards** - Related entities are grouped together logically rather than by physical device

**How it works:**

You can assign entities to sub-devices using the new `device_id` configuration option. First, define your devices
in the `devices` section under `esphome:`, then reference them in individual entities.

**Example configuration:**

```yaml
esphome:
  name: multi_room_controller

  # Define areas (optional)
  areas:
    - id: living_room_area
      name: "Living Room"
    - id: bedroom_area
      name: "Bedroom"

  # Define devices
  devices:
    - id: living_room_device
      name: "Living Room Sensors"
      area_id: living_room_area
    - id: bedroom_device
      name: "Bedroom Sensors"
      area_id: bedroom_area

# Assign sensors to different devices
sensor:
  - platform: dht
    pin: GPIO4
    temperature:
      name: "Living Room Temperature"
      device_id: living_room_device
    humidity:
      name: "Living Room Humidity"
      device_id: living_room_device

  - platform: dht
    pin: GPIO5
    temperature:
      name: "Bedroom Temperature"
      device_id: bedroom_device
    humidity:
      name: "Bedroom Humidity"
      device_id: bedroom_device
```

In this example, Home Assistant will see two separate sensor devices (one for living room, one for bedroom)
even though they're controlled by a single ESPHome device.

This feature enhances the logical organization of your smart home while maintaining the efficiency of
centralized ESPHome device management.

ESPHome 2025.7.0 introduces support for Jinja2 template expressions within the existing substitutions system.
This enhancement extends the current `${ }` substitution syntax to support Jinja2 expressions, allowing for
more sophisticated value calculations and transformations.

**Enhanced substitution capabilities:**

- **Mathematical operations** - Perform calculations using substitution variables
- **Conditional expressions** - Use ternary operators and conditional logic
- **String formatting** - Advanced string manipulation and formatting
- **Type conversions** - Convert between strings, numbers, and other types
- **Filter operations** - Apply Jinja2 filters for data transformation

**Example usage:**

```yaml
substitutions:
  device_name: living_room_sensors
  num_sensors: 3
  base_pin: 4
  offset_voltage: 3.3
  enable_debugging: false
  sensor_config:
    update_interval: 60s
    accuracy_decimals: 2

sensor:
  - platform: adc
    pin: GPIO${base_pin}
    name: "${device_name} voltage"
    update_interval: ${sensor_config.update_interval}
    accuracy_decimals: ${sensor_config.accuracy_decimals}
    filters:
      # Convert ADC reading to actual voltage
      - multiply: ${offset_voltage / 4095}

  - platform: adc
    pin: GPIO${base_pin + 1}
    name: "${device_name} sensor ${num_sensors > 1 and 'secondary' or 'primary'}"
    accuracy_decimals: ${1 if num_sensors <= 2 else 2}
    update_interval: ${sensor_config.update_interval}

binary_sensor:
  - platform: gpio
    pin: GPIO${base_pin + 2}
    name: "${device_name} status ${enable_debugging and '(debug)' or ''}"
```

**Key features:**

- **Works within existing substitutions** - Uses the familiar `${ }` syntax you already know
- **Access to substitution variables** - All defined substitutions are available as Jinja variables
- **Dictionary and list access** - Use dot notation (`device.name`  ) or indexing (`pins[0]`  )
- **Mathematical functions** - Access to Python's math library (`math.sqrt`, `math.pi`, etc.)
- **Conditional logic** - Ternary operators and boolean expressions for dynamic values

**Benefits:**

- **More powerful substitutions** - Calculate complex values instead of just simple replacements
- **Reduced duplication** - Generate values programmatically based on other substitutions
- **Better maintainability** - Change base values and have dependent values update automatically
- **Enhanced flexibility** - Support for conditional values and complex transformations

This feature builds upon ESPHome's existing substitutions system, making it more powerful while maintaining
backward compatibility. It's particularly useful for responsive designs, calculated pin assignments,
and configurations that need to adapt based on device capabilities or user preferences.

For complete documentation and more examples, see the {{< docref "/components/substitutions" >}} guide.
