Automations are a very powerful aspect of ESPHome; they allow you to easily perform actions given some condition(s).

When you want your ESPHome device to respond to its environment, you use an automation. Here are some examples:

- Switch on a light when the cover is opened
- Transmit an infrared (IR) code when I press this button
- Turn on the heat when the temperature drops

This page serves as an index which will walk to through the process of using ESPHome automations--actions, triggers,
templates, and more--to customize your ESPHome device just how you like it.
