# Record Views

Display information about a record in an interface

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de8b7955-d549-4a3c-b578-2c5f0f013030)

## Design

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f797f36-e1e9-4615-a2b9-9c5e079f3bf4)

By default, each record type will have at least three views namely, Summary, News and Related Actions. The views are displayed as tabs under the record header.

The Summary view is displayed by default when the user clicks on a record item from the record list. A record type could also have up to 20 additional customizable views to display information sourced from the record type.

**Note:**

- We recommend using at most 6 views in a record.
- Before designing the views, set up a planning session with your PM. Establish how to group data in the views. Identify data elements that are related and how to meaningfully label that group in a section.

The progress bar at the top immediately presents status. Also, notice the use of a two column layout with the wider column presenting important information and relevant metadata presented in the second and narrower column.

A mix of horizontal and vertical tabs used to balance information density. Local action are presented as links in-context (on top of each card section).

The button label in the record view matches the verb in the form header. Also, the submit button label in the footer matches the verb in the form header.

Checklist:

|Item|Type|
|--- |--- |
|Place global actions next to the record header. Global actions affect the entire record. Examples include: “Update”, “Update Status”, Delete”, “Export”.|Related Actions|
|Limit global actions as much as possible. A good rule of thumb is to not use more than 3 global actions.|Related Actions|
|Avoid using icons in global actions.|Related Actions|
|Display global actions on views where there is relevant content. Else, hide the action.|Related Actions|
|Place local actions next to where the data resides on the view. Examples include: “Update Team” for a Contract Record View with a section that has a list of teams.|Related Actions|
|Use an icon for a local action if generally recognizable. Examples include Update, Delete or Create. Else, use a button with a label.|Related Actions|
|Be consistent with local actions - either use “icon + label” or just “label”. Avoid mixing the two styles.|Related Actions|
|Start each action label with a verb. Example: “Update Status” instead of “Status”|Related Actions|
|Use a display name that the user can clearly understand. Avoid using terms like “Manage <Record>” or “View Details”.|Related Actions|
|Avoid unnecessary terms in the action label if the view name or record header is in immediate context. Example: for a record’s global action, use “Update” instead of “Update <Record Name>”.|Related Actions|
|The action form header should match the action Display Name (button label)|Related Actions|
|The submit action of the form should match the form header. Example: If the form header is “Update Status”, then the submit action of the form should state “Update”|Related Actions|
|Use a dialog size that matches the form content. Avoid using a Large dialog size for sparse form content.|Related Actions|
|Treat Summary views as a Category 1 - Marketable UI|Views|
|Set the record header color to match the page background color (white or Default Background - #fafafc)|Views|
|Set the same page background color for all record view tabs|Views|
|Set the record header to fixed if the user needs to know which tab they are in when scrolling in the view|Views|
|Avoid using the News view|Views|
|Avoid using the Related Actions view unless you only have a summary view. If you only have a summary view, use the Related Actions view.|Views|
|Place record progress or status at the top of the summary view|Views|
|Use the summary view for immediate comprehension. Keep the content to the minimum information needed to highlight essential data, progress and actions.|Views|
|Before designing a record view, set up a planning session with your PM to identify the essential data elements to showcase in the summary versus non-essential data elements that can be surfaced in a different view|Views|
|Use other record views to highlight data that is of intermittent importance. Examples include: Audit history, list of documents, list of users etc.|Views|
|Avoid using more than 6 record views in a record. Use a combination of Record Views and Tabs as Side Navigation to balance information density.|Views|
|Depending on the information to display, use a one column or two column layout|Views|
|When using one column layout, center the component and set the width based on the amount of information to display. Use blank `a!columnLayout()s` to establish gutters on either side of the component.|Views|
|When using two column layouts, set two different column widths for the content. The primary content should be wider (usually WIDE) than the second content column (usually `NARROW_PLUS` or `MEDIUM`).|Views|
|When using two column layouts, include high priority information in the primary and wider content area and move secondary priority information (e.g.: record metadata) to the second and narrower column.|Views|
|Avoid using three column layouts|Views|
|Unless agreed upon with your PM as a Category 1 - Marketable UI, treat other views as Category 2 - Usability Focused UIs.|Views|
|Unless tagged as Category 1, use out of the box Appian SAIL components to display other views|Views|

  local!description: "The U.S. Government is seeking qualified vendors to provide Cybersecurity Incident Response Support to strengthen its ability to detect, mitigate, and respond to cybersecurity incidents. As cyber threats continue to evolve, this effort will enhance the security posture of federal networks and critical systems. The selected vendor will work closely with government cybersecurity teams to identify vulnerabilities, contain threats, and implement best practices for cyber defense.

Key responsibilities include incident detection and analysis, where the contractor will monitor network traffic, identify anomalies, and assess potential security breaches. In the event of an attack, the team will provide incident containment and mitigation strategies to isolate affected systems and prevent further damage. Additionally, forensic analysis and threat hunting will be conducted to uncover malicious activities, analyze malware, and determine root causes of security incidents.

Beyond immediate incident response, the contractor will assist in remediation and recovery efforts, ensuring that affected systems are restored securely and that proper security controls are in place to prevent recurrence. This includes providing recommendations for security hardening, implementing patches, and improving threat intelligence sharing. The vendor will also be responsible for creating detailed incident reports and documentation, summarizing response actions, lessons learned, and long-term security improvements.

This effort requires on-site and remote support, depending on the nature of the incident and agency requirements. Personnel assigned to the contract must hold relevant cybersecurity certifications such as CISSP, CEH, or GCFA and demonstrate experience with federal security frameworks, including NIST 800-61, FISMA, and CISA directives. The selected vendor should be capable of working in high-pressure environments, responding to real-time cyber threats, and collaborating with multiple government stakeholders.

With the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks targeting government infrastructure, this initiative is critical to strengthening national cybersecurity resilience. The government is looking for a vendor that not only responds to incidents but also proactively enhances cyber defense strategies. Vendors with a strong track record in federal cybersecurity incident response are encouraged to submit proposals demonstrating their expertise, technical approach, and past performance in similar engagements.",
  local!instructions: "Interested vendors must submit a comprehensive proposal detailing their approach to Cybersecurity Incident Response Support. The Technical Proposal should outline the vendor’s methodology for detecting, analyzing, and mitigating cybersecurity incidents. It must also include the qualifications of key personnel, relevant certifications such as CISSP, CEH, or GCFA, and experience working within federal cybersecurity frameworks like NIST 800-61, FISMA, and CISA directives. Vendors should demonstrate their ability to provide both on-site and remote support, as well as their capability to respond to a wide range of cyber threats.

Additionally, proposals should address the vendor’s ability to support proactive threat hunting, cloud security incident response, and supply chain risk assessments. As threats continue to evolve, the government requires a contractor that can not only respond to incidents but also identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities before they are exploited. Vendors should highlight their experience in monitoring multi-cloud environments, securing software supply chains, and implementing advanced threat detection techniques.

The Past Performance section should highlight the vendor’s experience supporting federal agencies in cybersecurity incident response. Offerors should provide summaries of previous engagements, showcasing their ability to respond to cyber incidents effectively, implement security improvements, and collaborate with government cybersecurity teams. Client references or performance evaluations from similar projects will strengthen the proposal. Demonstrated success in handling complex cyber threats, particularly within government or critical infrastructure environments, will be a key evaluation factor.

A Price Proposal must also be included, providing a detailed breakdown of labor categories, hourly rates, and total estimated costs. The government seeks cost-effective solutions that balance affordability with high-quality cybersecurity expertise. All proposals will be evaluated based on technical capability, past performance, and price reasonableness to ensure the selection of the most qualified vendor for this critical cybersecurity initiative.",
