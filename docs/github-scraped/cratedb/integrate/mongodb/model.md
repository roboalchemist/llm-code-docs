# MongoDB's data model

MongoDB stores data in collections and documents. CrateDB stores
data in tables and rows.

- A **database** in MongoDB is a physical container for collections, roughly
  corresponding to a schema in CrateDB, which groups tables together.
- A **collection** in MongoDB is a grouping of documents, similar to a table
  in CrateDB, which is a structured collection of rows.
- A **document** in MongoDB is a record in a collection, similar to a row in 
  a CrateDB table. It is a set of key-value pairs. Note: Nested structures can
  be modeled in CrateDB using OBJECT columns when appropriate.
- A **field** in MongoDB is similar to a column in a CrateDB table. In both
  systems, fields (or columns) define the attributes for the records
  (or rows/documents).
- A **primary key** in MongoDB is typically the `_id` field, which uniquely
  identifies a document within a collection. In CrateDB, a primary key
  uniquely identifies a row in a table.
- An **index** in MongoDB is similar to an index in CrateDB. Both are used to
  improve query performance by providing a fast lookup for fields (or columns)
  within documents (or rows).
