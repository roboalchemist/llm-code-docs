:::{rubric} About
:::

[MLflow] is an open-source platform to manage the whole ML lifecycle, including
experimentation, reproducibility, deployment, and a central model registry.

The [MLflow adapter for CrateDB], available through the [mlflow-cratedb] package
on PyPI, provides support to use CrateDB as a storage database for the
[MLflow Tracking] subsystem, which is about recording and querying experiments,
across code, data, config, and results.

**Blog: Running Time Series Models in Production using CrateDB**

Part 1: Introduction to [Time Series Modeling using Machine Learning]

The article will introduce you to the concept of time series modeling,
discussing the main obstacles running it in production.
It will introduce you to CrateDB, highlighting its key features and
benefits, why it stands out in managing time series data, and why it is
an especially good fit for supporting machine learning models in production.
