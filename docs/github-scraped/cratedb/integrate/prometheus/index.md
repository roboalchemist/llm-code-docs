:::{rubric} About
:::

[Prometheus] is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit
for collecting metrics data from applications and infrastructures.
[CrateDB] can be used as a long-term storage for Prometheus metrics.

::::{dropdown} **Details**

Prometheus collects and stores its metrics as time series data, i.e.
metrics information is stored with the timestamp at which it was recorded,
alongside optional key-value pairs called labels.

:::{rubric} Features
:::
Prometheus's main features are:

- a multidimensional data model with time series data identified by metric name and key/value pairs
- PromQL, a flexible query language to leverage this dimensionality
- no reliance on distributed storage; single server nodes are autonomous
- time series collection happens via a pull model over HTTP
- pushing time series is supported via an intermediary gateway
- targets are discovered via service discovery or static configuration
- multiple modes of graphing and dashboarding support

:::{rubric} Remote Endpoints and Storage
:::

The [Prometheus remote endpoints and storage] subsystem, based on its
[remote write] and [remote read] features, allows to transparently
send and receive metric samples. It is primarily intended for long-term
storage.

This is where CrateDB comes into place: The [CrateDB Prometheus
Adapter] stores collected metrics data into CrateDB and
takes advantage of its high ingestion and query speed to
massively scale-out Prometheus.
