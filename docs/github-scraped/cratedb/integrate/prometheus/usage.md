# Store Prometheus long-term metrics into CrateDB

This usage guide shows how to use Docker Compose to run the services
CrateDB, Prometheus, and the [CrateDB Prometheus Adapter].

## Prerequisites

Use Docker or Podman to run all components. This approach works consistently
across Linux, macOS, and Windows.

### Files

First, download and save all required files to your machine.
- {download}`compose.yaml`
- {download}`cratedb-prometheus-adapter.yaml`
- {download}`ddl.sql`
- {download}`prometheus.yml`

### Services

Start services using Docker Compose or Podman Compose.
If you use Podman, replace `docker` with `podman` (or enable the podman‑docker
compatibility shim) and run `podman compose up`.

```shell
docker compose up
```

## Explore data

CrateDB stores the metrics in the designated table, ready for inspection and analysis.
By default, the included `ddl.sql` creates the table `testdrive.metrics`.
```shell
docker compose exec cratedb crash -c "SELECT * FROM testdrive.metrics ORDER BY timestamp LIMIT 5;"
```

## Screenshots

Navigate to `http://localhost:9090` to open the Prometheus UI. Go to **Status** → **Targets**.

Confirm that Prometheus monitors itself.

Return to the CrateDB Admin UI at `http://localhost:4200` and select the `testdrive.metrics` table.

After a few minutes, Prometheus will have gathered a few thousand data points.

Use CrateDB’s query engine to analyze and visualize this data with tools
like {ref}`grafana`. See also
