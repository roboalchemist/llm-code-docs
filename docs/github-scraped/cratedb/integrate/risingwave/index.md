:::{rubric} About
:::

[RisingWave] is a stream processing and management platform that allows
configuring data sources, views on that data, and destinations where
results are materialized.
It provides both a Postgres-compatible SQL interface, like CrateDB,
and a DataFrame-style Python interface.

> Deliver fresh, low-latency insights from real-time streams,
> database CDC, and time-series data. Bring streaming and batch together,
> let users join and analyze both live and historical data, and persist
> results in managed Apache Iceberg™ tables.

:::{rubric} Synopsis
:::

:RisingWave:
  Load an Apache Iceberg table, and serve it as a materialized view.
  ```sql
  CREATE SOURCE sensors_readings
  WITH (
    connector = 'iceberg',
    database.name='db.db',
    warehouse.path='s3://warehouse/',
    table.name='sensors_readings',
    s3.endpoint = '<YOUR_S3_ENDPOINT>',
    s3.access.key = '<YOUR_S3_ACCESS_KEY>',
    s3.secret.key = '<YOUR_S3_SECRET_KEY>',
    s3.region = '<YOUR_S3_REGION_NAME>'
  );
  ```
  ```sql
  CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW average_sensor_readings AS
  SELECT
    sensor_id,
    AVG(reading) AS average_reading
  FROM sensors_readings
  GROUP BY sensor_id;
  ```
:CrateDB:
  Ingest it into a CrateDB table for long-term persistence and efficient querying,
  even at large scale.
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE public.average_sensor_readings (
    sensor_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    average_reading DOUBLE
  );
  ```

and sinks it into CrateDB.

:::{rubric} Interoperability
:::

:::{note}
The standard approach with RisingWave would be to use its [CREATE SINK] operation
to connect to an external target.
However, because this does not currently support CrateDB, a little Python event processor
is needed to relay the data. An example implementation can be found in the tutorial
referenced above.
:::

:::{note}
We are tracking compatibility issues per [Tool: RisingWave] and appreciate
any contributions and reports.
