:::{rubric} About
:::

:::{div}
[Apache Airflow] is an open source software platform to programmatically author,
schedule, and monitor workflows, written in Python.
[Astronomer] offers managed Airflow services on the cloud of your choice, to
run Airflow with less overhead.
:::

:::{dropdown} **Details**
Airflow has a modular architecture and uses a message queue to orchestrate an
arbitrary number of workers. Pipelines are defined in Python, allowing for
dynamic pipeline generation and on-demand, code-driven pipeline invocation.

Use Jinja templates to parameterize Airflow pipelines.
To extend the system, you can define your own operators and extend libraries
to fit the level of abstraction that suits your environment.
