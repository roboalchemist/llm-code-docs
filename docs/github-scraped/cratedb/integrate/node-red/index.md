:::{rubric} About
:::

[Node-RED] is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs
and online services within a low-code programming environment for event-driven
applications. It allows orchestrating message flows and transformations through
an intuitive web interface.

It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows
using the wide range of elements called "nodes" from the palette that can be
deployed to its runtime in a single-click.

```

With [FlowFuse], and [FlowFuse Cloud], essentially unmanaged and managed DevOps
for Node-RED, you can reliably deliver Node-RED applications in a continuous,
collaborative, and secure manner.

- **Collaborative Development:** FlowFuse adds team collaboration to Node-RED,
  allowing multiple developers to work together on a single instance. With
  FlowFuse, developers can easily share projects, collaborate in real-time and
  streamline workflow for faster development and deployment.
- **Manage Remote Deployments:** Many organizations deploy Node-RED instances to
  remote servers or edge devices. FlowFuse automates this process by creating
  snapshots on Node-RED instances that can be deployed to multiple remote targets.
  It also allows for rollback in cases where something might not have gone correctly.
- **Streamline Application Delivery:** FlowFuse simplifies the software development
  lifecycle of Node-RED applications. You can now set up DevOps delivery pipelines
  to support development, test and production environments for Node-RED application
  delivery, see [Introduction to FlowFuse].
- **Flexible FlowFuse Deployment:** We want to make it easy for you to use FlowFuse,
  so we offer FlowFuse Cloud, a managed cloud service, or a self-hosted solution.
  You have the freedom to choose the deployment method that works best for your
  organization.
