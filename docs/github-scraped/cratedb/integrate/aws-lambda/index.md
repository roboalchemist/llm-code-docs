[AWS Lambda] is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to
events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you.
Events can include state changes and updates.

Kinesis stream, and to consume that from an adapter to write into an analytical
or long-term storage consolidation database like CrateDB.
