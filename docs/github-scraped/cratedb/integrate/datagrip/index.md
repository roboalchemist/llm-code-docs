[DataGrip] is a cross-platform database IDE that is tailored to suit the
specific needs of professional SQL developers.

It is available as a standalone application and is also included in
other JetBrains products like IntelliJ IDEA and PyCharm.

Connecting DataGrip to CrateDB uses the [CrateDB JDBC Driver].
