:::

[MySQL] and [MariaDB] are well-known free and open-source relational database
management systems (RDBMS), available as standalone and managed variants.

:::{dropdown} **Details**
MySQL is a component of the LAMP web application software stack (and others),
which is an acronym for Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl/PHP/Python.

When Oracle acquired Sun in 2010, Monty Widenius, MySQL's founder, forked the
open-source MySQL project to create MariaDB.
