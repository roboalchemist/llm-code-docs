:::{rubric} Notes
:::
:::{note}
A few data types of CrateDB need special considerations.
- `ARRAY` types are recognised as such in reads, also work for inserts through the GUI.
  They need to use curly brackets syntax `{1,2}` instead of `[1,2]`.
- `OBJECT` types are seen as string, and are ok to insert via GUI.
- `GEO_POINT` types are seen as `STRING`, for insert through GUI, please use parentheses.
- `GEO_SHAPE` types are seen as `STRING`, are ok to insert via GUI.
- `FLOAT_VECTOR` types are seen as `ARRAY` on read, and can be inserted
  using the GUI with same considerations as `ARRAY`s.
