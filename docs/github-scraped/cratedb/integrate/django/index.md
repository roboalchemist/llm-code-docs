The CrateDB team develops and supports a custom-built driver, [cratedb-django](https://github.com/crate/cratedb-django)

## Getting started


Installing the library:
```shell
pip install cratedb-django
```

Once the library is installed, set the appropriate `settings.py`

```python
DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "cratedb_django",
        "SERVERS": ["localhost:4200"],
    }
}

DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD = "cratedb_django.fields.AutoUUIDField"
```

For a model to be compatible with CrateDB, import and use `CrateDBModel`:

```python
from cratedb_django.models import fields
from cratedb_django.models import CrateDBModel

class Metrics(CrateDBModel):
    value = fields.IntegerField()
```

Django migrations can be run in CrateDB, all migrations for the default 
applications (contrib, auth, admin...) are tested and work.
In spite of that, it's recommended that you run anything transactional in a
transactional database, like Postgres and use CrateDB as your analytical 
database.

CrateDB has certain constraints that make migration management different.

## What's supported?

Django ORM has many features, see [feature-list](https://github.com/crate/cratedb-django/issues/50) for a comprehensive 
list of supported features. Feel free to open a new issue if you need a new feature.
