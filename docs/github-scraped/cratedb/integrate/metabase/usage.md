# Visualize data with Metabase

This usage guide introduces [Metabase], an ultimate data analysis and visualization
tool that unlocks the full potential of your data.

(metabase-prereqs)=

## Prerequisites

First, you will need a running cluster. You can use Metabase with both
CrateDB self-managed and its managed [CrateDB Cloud] offering.

To use Metabase, you must have an existing data set in your CrateDB cluster.
Feel free to use the sample dataset available in the [Cloud Console] or
import your own data similarly to how it's done [in this how-to].

(integration-metabase-config)=

## Configure the database connection

Metabase offers both a cloud version and a local installation. E.g.
`` `shell
podman run -d -p 3000:3000 --name metabase docker.io/metabase/metabase:v0.47.13
` ``
Whichever you choose, the first step will be to add your CrateDB cluster as a
new database. To do that, go to `Admin Settings` -> `Setup` and choose
the `Add a database` option.

:alt: Add new database
```

Database configuration is relatively simple, these are the necessary fields:

- Database type (PostgreSQL)
- Display name
- Host (the URI of your cluster)
- Database name
- Username
- Password

:::{NOTE}
Make sure you also select "Use a secure connection (SSL)" option, unless
your cluster is not configured for SSL.

```

After submitting your details, Metabase will sync with your CrateDB cluster for
a few moments. When that completes, you will get a message saying, "Syncing
complete".

## Visualize the data

Now you are ready to visualize your data. Metabase works by asking questions.
You ask a question, and Metabase answers it in a visual form. These questions
can then be saved to form dashboards. To ask a question, go to `Home` and
click on `New` -> `Question` in the upper right corner. Then select the
database and a table from it.

As an example, we ask for the average tip amount, sorted by the passenger count.

```{image} /_assets/img/integrations/metabase/metabase-question.png
:alt: Asking a question
```

Metabase then provides a visualization of that question.

```{image} /_assets/img/integrations/metabase/metabase-answer.png
:alt: Answer
```

The answer that you get can be saved. When you save a question, you will also
be asked if you want to add it to a dashboard. Dashboards provide an easy way
to monitor your data.

## Conclusion

This was an introductory usage guide into the data visualization tool Metabase.
Metabase offers a quick and intuitive way to make sense of your data with
interactive dashboards, automated reporting, and more.

check out the [video tutorial] on this topic.

If this integration could benefit you, feel free to head to [CrateDB Cloud]
and get started!
