CrateDB provides a vector type natively, and adapters for integrating
with machine learning frameworks.
:::

Modern AI and machine learning applications demand efficient storage and
retrieval of high-dimensional vectors, seamless integration with ML frameworks,
and the ability to combine traditional analytics with semantic search capabilities.
From retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to predictive maintenance models,
organizations need a unified platform that handles vector embeddings, training datasets,
and production model artifacts without juggling multiple specialized systems.

CrateDB unifies vector search, time series analysis, and ML operations in a single
platform. Store and query high-dimensional embeddings using native FLOAT_VECTOR support
with HNSW-based similarity search, integrate directly with LangChain and LlamaIndex for
AI applications, and leverage MLflow and PyCaret for end-to-end MLOps workflows. Whether
you're building semantic search engines, training forecasting models on large time series
datasets, or implementing hybrid search combining full-text and vector similarity, CrateDB
eliminates data movement and infrastructure complexity.

By keeping vector embeddings, training data, and model metadata in one queryable system,
you avoid the overhead of synchronizing between specialized vector databases, data lakes,
and model registries. Your ML pipelines remain agile, your queries span structured and
vector data seamlessly, and your infrastructure stays lean.

With CrateDB, compatible to PostgreSQL, you can do all of that using plain SQL.
Other than integrating well with commodity systems using standard database
access interfaces like ODBC or JDBC, it provides a proprietary HTTP interface
on top.

## Vector store

:::{div}
[Vector databases][Vector Database] can be used for similarity search,
multi-modal search, recommendation engines, large language models (LLMs),
and other applications.

These applications can answer questions about specific sources of information,
for example using techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
RAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional data,
often private or real-time.

CrateDB supports high-dimensional vectors with `FLOAT_VECTOR`, e.g. to
store and query word embeddings using [HNSW]-based nearest neighbor search
through SQL.

:::{div}
Training a machine learning model, running it in production, and maintaining
it, requires a significant amount of data processing and bookkeeping
operations.

Machine Learning Operations [MLOps] is a paradigm that aims to deploy and
maintain machine learning models in production reliably and efficiently,
including experiment tracking, and in the spirit of continuous development
and DevOps.
