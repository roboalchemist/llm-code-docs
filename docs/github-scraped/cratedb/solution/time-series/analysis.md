## Anomaly detection and forecasting

To gain insights from your data in a one-shot or recurring way, based on
machine learning techniques, you may want to look into applying [anomaly]
detection and/or [forecasting] methods.

(timeseries-decomposition)=
## Time series decomposition

[Decomposition of time series] is a statistical task that deconstructs a [time
series] into several components, each representing one of the underlying
categories of patterns.

There are two principal types of decomposition, one based on rates of change,
the other based on predictability.

You can use this method to dissect a time series into multiple components,
typically including trend, seasonal, and random (or irregular) components.

This process helps in understanding the underlying patterns of the time series
data, such as identifying any long term direction (trend), recurring patterns
at fixed intervals (seasonality), and randomness (irregular fluctuations) in
the data.

Decomposition is crucial for analyzing how these components change over time,
improving forecasts, and developing strategies for addressing each element
effectively.

**Analyze trend, seasonality, and fluctuations with PyCaret and CrateDB**

Learn how to extract data from CrateDB for analysis in PyCaret, how to
further preprocess it and how to use PyCaret to plot time series
decomposition by breaking it down into its basic components: trend,
seasonality, and residual (or irregular) fluctuations.

(timeseries-eda)=
## Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

[Exploratory data analysis (EDA)] is an approach of analyzing data sets to
summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and
other data visualization methods.

EDA involves visualizing, summarizing, and analyzing data, to uncover
patterns, anomalies, or relationships within the dataset.

The objective of this step is to gain an understanding and intuition of the
data, identify potential issues, and, in machine learning, guide feature
engineering and model building.
