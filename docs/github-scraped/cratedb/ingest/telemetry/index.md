:::{rubric} About
:::

Provides long-term storage for metrics and telemetry data using standard
database interfaces, SQL, and horizontal scalability through clustering.

CrateDB keeps historical records immediately available for analysis
without cumbersome cold storage procedures.

:::{rubric} Introduction
:::

CrateDB works well for storing massive amounts of telemetry data, such as metrics and logs.

CrateDB can serve as an alternative to time-series databases and metric stores
like RRD, Whisper (Graphite), InfluxDB, Prometheus, Cortex, Mimir, Thanos,
or VictoriaMetrics,
while adding long‑term storage, standard database interfaces, SQL,
and horizontal scalability.

CrateDB integrates with metrics collection agents, brokers, and stores.
This documentation section lists applications and daemons which can
be used together with CrateDB, and educates about how to use them optimally.
