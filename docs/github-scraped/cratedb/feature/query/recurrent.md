# Automate recurrent CrateDB queries

Many database tasks run the same query repeatedly. You can schedule them.
This article shows several scheduling options and explains how to integrate them with CrateDB.

As an example, we implement continuous aggregates: precompute results to speed up repeated aggregations.

## Use Case: Continuous Aggregates

Our base table contains simple periodic sensor readings:
```sql
CREATE TABLE sensor_readings_raw (
  ts TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  sensor_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  "value" DOUBLE NOT NULL
);
```

Calculate an hourly average regularly with your analytics tool:
```sql
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('hour', ts),
       sensor_id,
       AVG(value)
FROM sensor_readings_raw;
```

In certain cases, precalculating the result improves performance when you face strict requirements or handle a high volume of identical queries.

We create a second table that stores the result set of the above query:
```sql
CREATE TABLE sensor_readings_aggregated (
  ts_hour TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  sensor_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  value_avg DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
  last_updated GENERATED ALWAYS AS NOW(),
  PRIMARY KEY(ts_hour, sensor_id)
);
```

The INSERT query below will populate the target table. To update already aggregated data (e.g. for the latest hour which still changes or if data arrives late), we consider the raw readings of the last six hours and use the [ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE](https://crate.io/docs/crate/reference/en/4.6/sql/statements/insert.html#on-conflict-do-update-set) clause to override previously existing data:
```sql
INSERT INTO sensor_readings_aggregated (ts_hour, sensor_id, value_avg)
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('hour', ts),
       sensor_id,
       AVG(value)
FROM sensor_readings_raw
WHERE ts >= DATE_TRUNC('hour', ts - '6 hours'::INTERVAL)
GROUP BY 1, 2
ON CONFLICT (ts_hour, sensor_id) DO UPDATE SET value_avg = excluded.value_avg;
```

Schedule this INSERT to refresh the aggregates regularly.


## Scheduling Methods

We will now go through several scheduling methods and how to use them for the given use case.

### cron
On Unix-based systems, use cron to schedule jobs.

:::{rubric} Prerequisites
:::
Install the CrateDB CLI client [crash](https://crate.io/docs/crate/crash/en/latest/).

:::{rubric} Setup
:::
1. Create a script ~/update_continuous_aggregates.sh with the following content (replace `<placeholders>` for CrateDB connection information accordingly):
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   UPDATE_QUERY=$(cat << QUERY
     INSERT INTO sensor_readings_aggregated (ts_hour, sensor_id, value_avg)
     SELECT DATE_TRUNC('hour', ts),
            sensor_id,
            AVG(value)
     FROM sensor_readings_raw
     WHERE ts >= DATE_TRUNC('hour', ts - '6 hours'::INTERVAL)
     GROUP BY 1, 2
     ON CONFLICT (ts_hour, sensor_id) DO UPDATE SET value_avg = excluded.value_avg;
   QUERY
   )

   CRATEPW=<CrateDB user password> crash -U <CrateDB user name> -c "${UPDATE_QUERY}" --hosts https://<CrateDB host>:4200 > /dev/null
   ```
2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x ~/update_continuous_aggregates.sh`
3. On the Unix command line, run `crontab -e` to edit the cron jobs of the current user. Add the following line to update aggregated data every five minutes:
`*/5 * * * * ~/update_continuous_aggregates.sh`

:::{rubric} Caveats
:::
Monitor your cron jobs. By default, the cron daemon delivers output (including errors) to the user's mailbox when you configure it.

You can also use third‑party cron monitoring services for deeper visibility.

### Apache Airflow
[Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) programmatically schedules and controls complex workflows. See our [crate-airflow-tutorial](https://github.com/crate/crate-airflow-tutorial) repository for examples.

### Node-RED
[Node-RED](https://nodered.org) is a low‑code tool that also offers scheduling.

:::{rubric} Prerequisites
:::
Install the [node-red-contrib-postgresql](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-postgresql) package.

### CrateDB Cloud - SQL Job Scheduler

CrateDB Cloud deployments offer the SQL Job Scheduler. The scheduler runs jobs at defined intervals through a centralized user interface. Use it to move data between tables or schedule regular data exports.

Use the Cloud Console Automation menu to create a new job. Define the name, interval, and the exact query to run. You can activate/deactivate the job and review its execution history.

:::{rubric} API access
:::

Besides the web interface, use `croud` to configure new jobs. Check the [documentation](https://cratedb.com/docs/cloud/cli/en/latest/commands/scheduled-jobs.html) for further details. For instance, to achieve the same result as the web UI, run the following command after you configure `croud` in your environment:

```bash
croud clusters scheduled-jobs create \
    --name update-continuous-aggregates \
    --cluster-id 8d6a7c3c-61d5-11e9-a639-34e12d2331a1 \
    --cron "*/5 * * * *" \
    --sql "INSERT INTO sensor_readings_aggregated (ts_hour, sensor_id, value_avg)
           SELECT DATE_TRUNC('hour', ts),
                  sensor_id,
                  AVG(value)
           FROM sensor_readings_raw
           WHERE ts >= DATE_TRUNC('hour', ts - '6 hours'::INTERVAL)
           GROUP BY 1, 2
           ON CONFLICT (ts_hour, sensor_id) DO UPDATE SET value_avg = excluded.value_avg;" \
    --enabled True 
```
