Connect to CrateDB from Go applications.
:::

The `pgx` and `pq` packages have been validated with CrateDB.
`pq` is in maintenance mode, so their authors recommend using
`pgx` which is under active development.

The `KSQL` package is a convenience wrapper that also uses the
`pgx` library to connect to CrateDB.
