:::{rubric} About
:::

The [RPostgres] package is the canonical C++ Interface to PostgreSQL,
which is actively maintained and often preferred.
An alternative is the [RPostgreSQL] package, written in C.

:::{rubric} Synopsis
:::

`example.r`
```r
# Connect to CrateDB from R, using the "RPostgres: C++ Interface to PostgreSQL".
# https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RPostgres/

# Install the Postgres library on demand.
if (!requireNamespace("RPostgres", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("RPostgres", repos="https://cran.r-project.org")
}

# Load the DBI and Postgres libraries.
library(DBI)
library(RPostgres)

# Connect to database.
conn <- dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres(),
                  host = "localhost",
                  port = 5432,
                  sslmode = "disable",
                  user = "crate",
                  password = "crate",
                  )
on.exit(DBI::dbDisconnect(conn), add = TRUE)

# Invoke a basic select query.
res <- dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT * FROM sys.summits ORDER BY height DESC LIMIT 10;")
print(res)
```

:::{rubric} SSL connection
:::

:::{div}
Use the `sslmode = "require"` parameter, and replace username, password,
and hostname with values matching your environment.
Also use this variant to connect to [CrateDB Cloud].
:::

```r
conn <- dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres(),
                  host = "testcluster.cratedb.net",
                  port = 5432,
                  sslmode = "require",
                  user = "admin",
                  password = "password",
                  )
```
