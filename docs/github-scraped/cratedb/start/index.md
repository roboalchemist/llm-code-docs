Get started fast with CrateDB: Setup or install CrateDB and try a few quick
tutorials.
:::

:::{note}
**Prefer video tutorials?** Then we have a more elaborate
<a href="https://learn.cratedb.com/" target="_blank">Academy Fundamentals course</a>
with hands-on video tutorials that walk you through setup or installation and key
concepts step by step. Or take the quick route below with our text-based
quickstart.
:::

We highly recommend to try out CrateDB with a free Cloud cluster for the
smoothest experience with integrated tutorials - no install, no
copy-pasting examples.
<br>
Alternatively, select "Local" below to install CrateDB with Docker and follow
the more manual tutorials.

## Create your free cluster

Sign up for CrateDB Cloud and create your first cluster in 2 minutes.

:::{button-link} https://console.cratedb.cloud/
:color: primary
**Start free with CrateDB Cloud →**
:::

After logging in you will see the Cloud Console Quickstart page, with
options to try tutorials, import data, or connect programmatically.

The Cloud Quickstart page
:::

## Run tutorials
Once your cluster is ready, you can go through one or more of the
**interactive tutorials** directly in the browser in ~5 minutes each.
With the click of a button you will import data, execute queries, and
see the results.

## Experiment in the Console
After completing a tutorial, the sample data remains in your cluster. You
can now use the **Console** in the Cloud UI to explore the data and run
your own SQL queries, perhaps with inspiration from our
{ref}`query-capabilities`.

## Install CrateDB

If you prefer to try CrateDB locally, the quickest way is using
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/" target="_blank">Docker</a>:

:::{code} shell
docker run -p 4200:4200 -p 5432:5432 crate:latest
:::

For other installation methods, see our {ref}`install` guide.

:::{caution}
By default, the CrateDB Docker container is ephemeral, so data will not be
stored in a persistent manner. When you stop the container, all data will
be lost. For production use, consult the {ref}`Docker guide
<cratedb-docker>` to configure persistent disk volumes.
:::

## Access the Admin UI

Once CrateDB is running, open your browser and navigate to
<http://localhost:4200/> to access the {ref}`Admin UI
<crate-admin-ui:index>`. From here you can:

* Browse tables and data
* Execute SQL queries
* Monitor cluster health

:::

You will use this in the next section to run SQL statements.

## Run tutorials
