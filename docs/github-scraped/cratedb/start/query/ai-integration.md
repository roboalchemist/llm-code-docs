:::{rubric} Introduction
:::

CrateDB is not just a real-time analytics database, it's a powerful platform to **feed and interact with machine learning models**, thanks to its ability to store, query, and transform **structured, unstructured, and vectorized data** at scale using standard **SQL**.

Whether you're training models, running batch or real-time inference, or integrating with AI pipelines, CrateDB offers:

- High ingestion performance for time-series or sensor data.
- SQL-powered transformations and filtering.
- Unified queries across structured and semi-structured data: \
  Full-text, vector, and JSON.
- Native support for embeddings via **FLOAT\_VECTOR** data type, \
  for conducting similarity searches in vector spaces (HNSW).

:::

| Use Case            | CrateDB Role                                          |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Feature Store       | Store pre-computed features with SQL access           |
| Real-Time Inference | Serve vector-based results with `KNN_MATCH`           |
| Experimentation     | Use SQL for fast slicing, filtering, and aggregations |
| Monitoring          | Track model performance, drift, or input quality      |
| Data Collection     | Capture telemetry, events, logs, and raw user data    |


:::{rubric} Use cases
:::

## Similarity search
**Feature:** Store and query [word embeddings] using [HNSW] nearest neighbor
search through SQL. CrateDB supports high-dimensional vectors with `FLOAT_VECTOR`.
To query these vectors for similarity-based inference, see
{ref}`Vector Search <vector-search>` and the quick synopsis below.

:::{grid-item}
Create a table using the `FLOAT_VECTOR` data type.
:::
:::{grid-item}
```sql

  text STRING PRIMARY KEY,
  embedding FLOAT_VECTOR(4)
);
```
:::
:::{grid-item}
Insert a few vectors.
:::
:::{grid-item}

VALUES
  ('Exploring the cosmos', [0.1, 0.5, -0.2, 0.8]),
  ('Discovering moon', [0.2, 0.4, 0.1, 0.7]),
  ('Discovering galaxies', [0.2, 0.4, 0.2, 0.9]),
  ('Sending the mission', [0.5, 0.9, -0.1, -0.7])

**Feature Engineering:** Use SQL to build features dynamically from raw data.
:::
:::{grid-item}
```sql
SELECT
  user_id,
  AVG(duration) AS avg_session,
  COUNT(DISTINCT page) AS page_diversity
FROM sessions
GROUP BY user_id;

FROM user_features
WHERE last_active > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day';
```
:::
:::{grid-item}
**Training Dataset Extraction:**
Efficiently extract and filter relevant training data from large datasets using plain SQL.
:::
:::{grid-item}
```sql
SELECT *
FROM telemetry
WHERE temperature > 80
  AND error_code IS NOT NULL
  AND ts BETWEEN NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days' AND NOW();
```
