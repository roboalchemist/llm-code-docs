# CrateDB on Windows

How to use the release archives to run CrateDB on Microsoft Windows.

:::{CAUTION}
We do not officially support CrateDB on Windows for production use. If
you would like to deploy CrateDB on Windows, please feel free to [contact
us][contact us] so we can work with you on a solution.

## Download

Download the latest [CrateDB release archive] for Windows.

## Extract the archive

Once downloaded, extract the archive either using your favorite terminal or
command-line shell or by using a GUI tool like [7-Zip]. We recommend
using [PowerShell] when using terminal:

Using PowerShell:
```powershell
Expand-Archive -Path .\crate-*.zip -DestinationPath .
```

Using tar (Windows 10 1803 and newer):
```doscon
tar -xf .\crate-*.zip
```

## Navigate to directory

On the terminal, change into the extracted `crate` directory:

```doscon
cd crate-*
```

## Run CrateDB

Run a CrateDB single-node instance on the local network interface:

```doscon
./bin/crate
```

## Verify startup

You will be notified by an INFO message similar to this, when your
single-node cluster is started successfully:

```text
[2022-07-04T19:41:12,340][INFO ][o.e.n.Node] [Aiguille Verte] started
```

## Stop CrateDB

In order to stop CrateDB again, use {kbd}`ctrl-c`. You will be asked to
terminate the job. Input {kbd}`Y`:

```text
Terminate batch job (Y/N)? Y
```

::::::

:::{SEEALSO}
Consult the {ref}`crate-reference:cli` documentation for further information
about the `./bin/crate` command.
:::

:::{NOTE}
If you are installing CrateDB on a recent [Windows Server] edition,
setting up the latest *Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 Redistributable* package
is required. You can download it at [msvcrt x86-64], [msvcrt x86-32] or [msvcrt ARM64].

Within the terminal, as a Windows user, the prompt after
[starting PowerShell] will look like this.

```doscon
PS> ./bin/crate
```
