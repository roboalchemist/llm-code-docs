# Configuration settings

In order to configure CrateDB, please take note of the configuration file
locations and the available environment variables.

## Configuration files

When using the package-based setup flavor for {ref}`install-deb` or
{ref}`install-rpm`, the main CrateDB configuration files are located within the
`/etc/crate` directory.

When using the {ref}`install-tarball` setup, or the {ref}`Microsoft Windows <install-windows>`
setup, the configuration files are located within the `config/` directory relative to the
working directory.

## Environment variables

For the vanilla package-based setup flavor, the CrateDB startup script reads
{ref}`crate-reference:conf-env` from the `/etc/default/crate` file as
environment variables.

:::{Note}
RPM packages of CrateDB versions up to [5.2.11], [5.3.8], [5.4.7]
and [5.5.2] are using the `/etc/sysconfig/crate` file instead.
:::

When using the {ref}`install-tarball` setup, or the {ref}`Microsoft Windows <install-windows>`
setup, the environment variables will be defined by `bin/crate{.sh,.bat}` relative to the
working directory.

Here is an example:

```shell
# Configure heap size (defaults to 256m min, 1g max).
CRATE_HEAP_SIZE=2g

# Maximum number of open files, defaults to 65535.
# MAX_OPEN_FILES=65535

# Maximum locked memory size. Set to "unlimited" if you use the
# bootstrap.mlockall option in crate.yml. You must also set
# CRATE_HEAP_SIZE.
MAX_LOCKED_MEMORY=unlimited

# Provide additional Java OPTS.
# CRATE_JAVA_OPTS=

# Force the JVM to use IPv4 only.
CRATE_USE_IPV4=true
```
