(multi-node-setup)=

# Multi-node setup

CrateDB can run on a single node. However, in most environments, CrateDB is run
as a cluster of three or more nodes.

For development purposes, CrateDB can {ref}`auto-bootstrap
<auto-bootstrapping>` a cluster when you run all nodes on the same host.
However, in production environments, you must configure the bootstrapping
process {ref}`manually <manual-bootstrapping>`.

This guide shows you how to bootstrap (set up) a multi-node CrateDB cluster
using different methods.

(cluster-bootstrapping)=

## Cluster bootstrapping

Starting a CrateDB cluster for the first time requires the initial list of
master-eligible nodes to be defined. This is known as *cluster bootstrapping*.

This process is only necessary the first time a cluster starts because:

- nodes that are already part of a cluster will remember this information if
  the cluster restarts
- new nodes that need to join a cluster will obtain this information from the
  cluster's elected master node

(auto-bootstrapping)=

### Single-host auto-bootstrapping

If you start up several nodes (with default configuration) on a single host,
the nodes will automatically discover one another and form a cluster. This
does not require any configuration.

If you want to run CrateDB on your local machine for development or
experimentation purposes, this is probably your best option.

:::{CAUTION}
For better performance and resiliency, {ref}`production
<going-into-production>` CrateDB clusters should be run with {ref}`one node
per host machine <manual-bootstrapping>`. If you use multiple hosts, you
must {ref}`manually bootstrap <manual-bootstrapping>` your cluster.
:::

:::{WARNING}
If you start multiple nodes on different hosts with auto-bootstrapping
enabled, you cannot, at a later point, merge those nodes together to form
a single cluster without the risk of data loss.

If you have multiple nodes running on different hosts, you can check
whether they have formed independent clusters by visiting the
{ref}`Admin UI <crate-admin-ui:index>`
(which runs on every node) and checking the [cluster browser].

If you end up with multiple independent clusters and instead want to
form a single cluster, follow these steps:

1. {ref}`Back up your data <crate-reference:snapshot-restore>`
2. Shut down all the nodes
3. Completely wipe each node by deleting the contents of the `data`
   directory under [CRATE_HOME]
4. Follow the instructions in {ref}`manual bootstrapping
   <manual-bootstrapping>`)
5. Restart all the nodes and verify that they have formed a single cluster
6. Restore your data
:::

(auto-bootstrapping-tarball)=

#### Tarball installation

If you are installing CrateDB using the {ref}`tarball method <install-tarball>`,
you can start a
single-host three-node cluster with auto-bootstrapping by following these
instructions.

::::::{stepper}

### Unpack the tarball

```console
sh$ tar -xzf crate-*.tar.gz
```

### Configure metadata gateway

It is common to configure the {ref}`metadata gateway <metadata-gateway>` so
that the cluster waits for all data nodes to be online before starting the
recovery of the shards. In this case, let's set
[gateway.expected_data_nodes] to **3** and
[gateway.recover_after_data_nodes] also to **3**. You can specify these
settings in the [configuration] file of the unpacked directory.

:::{NOTE}
Configuring the {ref}`metadata gateway <metadata-gateway>` is a safeguarding
mechanism that is
useful for production clusters. It is not strictly necessary when running
in development. However, the {ref}`Admin UI <crate-admin-ui:index>` will
issue warnings if you have not configured the metadata gateway.
:::

:::{SEEALSO}
The {ref}`metadata gateway <metadata-gateway>` section includes examples.
:::

### Copy directories for each node

Copy the unpacked directory into a new directory, three times, one for each
node. For example:

```console
sh$ cp -R crate-*/ node-01
sh$ cp -R crate-*/ node-02
sh$ cp -R crate-*/ node-03
```

:::{TIP}
Each directory will function as [CRATE_HOME] for that node
:::

### Start all nodes

Start up all three nodes by changing into each node directory and running
the [bin/crate] script.

:::{CAUTION}
You must change into the appropriate node directory before running the
[bin/crate] script.

When you run [bin/crate], the script sets [CRATE_HOME] to your current
directory. This directory must be the root of a CrateDB installation.
:::

:::{TIP}
Because you are supposed to run [bin/crate] as a [daemon] (i.e., a
long-running process), the most straightforward way to run multiple
nodes for testing purposes is to start a new terminal session for each
node. In each session, change into the appropriate node directory, run
[bin/crate], and leave this process running. You should now have
multiple concurrent [bin/crate] processes.
:::

### Verify the cluster

Visit the {ref}`Admin UI <crate-admin-ui:index>` on one of the nodes. Check the
[cluster browser] to
verify that the cluster has auto-bootstrapped with three nodes. You should see
something like this:

```{image} /_assets/img/multi-node-cluster.png
:alt: The CrateDB Admin UI showing a multi-node cluster
```
::::::

(manual-bootstrapping)=

### Manual bootstrapping

To run a CrateDB cluster across multiple hosts, you must manually configure the
bootstrapping process by telling nodes how to:

1. {ref}`Discover other nodes <node-discovery>`
2. {ref}`Elect a master node <master-node-election>` the first time

You can also configure the {ref}`metadata gateway <metadata-gateway>` (as with
auto-bootstrapping).

(node-discovery)=

#### Node discovery

##### Seeding manually

With CrateDB 4.x and above, you can configure a list of nodes to {ref}`seed the
discovery process <crate-reference:conf_discovery>` with the
`discovery.seed_hosts` setting in your
[configuration] file. This setting should contain one identifier per
master-eligible node. For example:

```yaml
discovery.seed_hosts:
  - node-01.example.com:4300
  - 10.0.1.102:4300
  - 10.0.1.103:4300
```

Alternatively, you can configure this at startup with a command-line option.
For example:

```console
sh$ bin/crate -Cdiscovery.seed_hosts=node-01.example.com,10.0.1.102,10.0.1.103
```

:::{NOTE}
You must configure every node with a list of seed nodes. Each node
discovers the rest of the cluster via the seed nodes.
:::


(unicast-discovery)=

##### Unicast host discovery

Instead of configuring seed hosts manually ({ref}`as above <node-discovery>`),
you can configure CrateDB to fetch a list of seed hosts from an external source.

The currently supported sources are:

1. {ref}`DNS <crate-reference:conf_dns_discovery>`

   To enable DNS discovery, configure the `discovery.seed_providers` setting
   in your [configuration] file to `srv`:

   ```yaml
   discovery.seed_providers: srv
   ```

   CrateDB will perform a DNS query using [SRV records] and use the results to
   generate a list of [unicast hosts] for node discovery.

2. {ref}`Amazon EC2 <crate-reference:conf_ec2_discovery>`

   To enable Amazon EC2 discovery, configure the `discovery.seed_providers`
   setting in your [configuration] file:

   ```yaml
   discovery.seed_providers: ec2
   ```

   CrateDB will perform an [Amazon EC2 API] query and use the results to
   generate a list of [unicast hosts] for node discovery.

3. Microsoft Azure

   :::{WARNING}
   Microsoft Azure discovery was deprecated in CrateDB 5.0.0
   and removed in {ref}`5.1.0 <crate-reference:version_5.1.0>`.
   :::

   To enable Microsoft Azure discovery, configure the `discovery.seed_providers`
   setting in your [configuration] file:

   ```yaml
   discovery.seed_providers: azure
   ```

   CrateDB will perform an [Azure Virtual Machine API] query and use the results
   to generate a list of [unicast hosts] for node discovery.

(master-node-election)=

#### Master node election

The master node is responsible for making changes to the global cluster state.
The cluster {ref}`elects the master node <crate-reference:concept-master-election>`
from the configured list of
master-eligible nodes the first time a cluster is bootstrapped. This is not
necessary if nodes are added later or are restarted.

In development mode, with no discovery settings configured, master election is
performed by the nodes themselves, but this auto-bootstrapping is designed to
aid development and is not safe for production. In production you must
explicitly list the names or IP addresses of the master-eligible nodes whose
votes should be counted in the very first election.

If initial master nodes are not set, then new nodes will expect to be able to
discover an existing cluster. If a node cannot find a cluster to join, then it
will periodically log a warning message indicating that the master is not
discovered or elected yet.

You can define the initial set of master-eligible nodes with the
[cluster.initial_master_nodes] setting in your [configuration] file. This
setting should contain one identifier per master-eligible node. For example:

```yaml
cluster.initial_master_nodes:
  - node-01.example.com
  - 10.0.1.102
  - 10.0.1.103
```

Alternatively, you can configure this at startup with a command-line option.
For example:

```console
sh$ bin/crate -Ccluster.initial_master_nodes=node-01.example.com,10.0.1.102,10.0.1.10
```

:::{WARNING}
You do not have to configure [cluster.initial_master_nodes] on every node.
However, you must configure [cluster.initial_master_nodes] identically
whenever you do configure it, otherwise CrateDB may form multiple
independent clusters (which may result in data loss).
:::

CrateDB requires a [quorum] of nodes before a master can be elected. A quorum
ensures that the cluster does not elect multiple masters in the event of a
network partition (also known as a [split-brain] scenario).

(metadata-gateway)=

#### Metadata gateway

When running a multi-node cluster, you can configure the {ref}`metadata gateway <metadata-gateway>`
settings so that CrateDB delays recovery until a certain number of nodes is
available.
This is useful because if recovery is started when some nodes are down
CrateDB will proceed on the basis that the nodes that are down may not come
back, creating new replicas and rebalance shards as necessary.
This is an expensive operation that, depending on the context, may be better
avoided if the nodes are only down for a short period of time.
So, for instance, for a three-nodes cluster, you can decide to set
[gateway.expected_data_nodes] to **3**, and
[gateway.recover_after_data_nodes] also to **3**.

You can specify both settings in your [configuration] file:

```yaml
gateway:
  recover_after_data_nodes: 3
  expected_data_nodes: 3
```

Alternatively, you can configure these settings at startup with command-line
options:

```console
sh$ bin/crate \
    -Cgateway.expected_data_nodes=3 \
    -Cgateway.recover_after_data_nodes=3
```

(multi-node-setup-example)=

## Example

This walkthrough illustrates how to set up a multi-node CrateDB cluster
on two Ubuntu machines.

First, prepare CrateDB for a production setup by explicitly configuring
its JVM heap size to satisfy bootstrap checks.
```shell
nano /etc/default/crate
```
```ini
CRATE_HEAP_SIZE=4G
```

Then, configure the cluster setup using a YAML file.
```shell
mkdir /etc/crate
nano /etc/crate/crate.yml
```
```yaml
# Tell CrateDB to respond to requests both from localhost and the local network.
network.host: _local_,_site_

# List all the machines that make up our cluster.
# For production use, we recommend to use at least three nodes so that a quorum
# can be established in case of network partition to avoid split-brain scenarios.
discovery.seed_hosts:
  - ubuntuvm1:4300
  - ubuntuvm2:4300

# List the nodes that are eligible to act as master nodes during bootstrap.
cluster.initial_master_nodes:
  - ubuntuvm1
  - ubuntuvm2

# Require both nodes to be available for the cluster to operate.
# With more nodes, we could have set `recover_after_data_nodes`
# to a value smaller than the total number of nodes.
gateway.recover_after_data_nodes: 2
gateway.expected_data_nodes: 2

# Configure that the `crate` superuser will be trusted to authenticate without
# password for local connections, but connections from other machines will
# require credentials.
auth.host_based.enabled: true
auth:
  host_based:
    config:
      0:
        user: crate
        address: _local_
        method: trust
      99:
        method: password
```

Install CrateDB from the Debian/Ubuntu package repository.
```bash
apt update
apt install --yes gpg lsb-release wget
wget -O- https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/debian/DEB-GPG-KEY-crate | gpg --dearmor | tee /usr/share/keyrings/crate.gpg >/dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/crate.gpg] https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/debian/stable/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/crate.list
apt update
apt install crate -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-confold"
```
Use `force-confold` to keep the configuration files created earlier.
Otherwise, they would be overwritten.

Repeat the above steps on the other node and start CrateDB on both machines.
```bash
systemctl start crate
```

(multi-node-other)=

## Other settings

(multi-node-cluster-name)=

### Cluster name

The [cluster.name] setting allows you to create multiple separate clusters. A
node will refuse to join a cluster if the respective cluster names do not
match.

By default, CrateDB sets the cluster name to `crate` for you.

You can override this behavior by configuring a custom cluster name using the
[cluster.name] setting in your [configuration] file:

```yaml
cluster.name: my_cluster
```

Alternatively, you can configure this setting at startup with a command-line
option:

```console
sh$ bin/crate -Ccluster.name=my_cluster
```

(multi-node-node-name)=

### Node name

If you are {ref}`manually bootstrapping <manual-bootstrapping>` a cluster, you
must specify a list of master-eligible nodes ({ref}`see above
<master-node-election>`). To do this, you must refer to nodes by node name,
hostname, or IP address.

By default, CrateDB sets the node name to a random value from the
{ref}`crate-reference:sys-summits` table.

You can override this behavior by configuring a custom node name using the
[node.name] setting in your [configuration] file. For example:

```yaml
node.name: node-01
```

Alternatively, you can configure this setting at startup with a command-line
option:

```console
sh$ bin/crate -Cnode.name=node-01
```

(master-eligible-nodes)=

### Master-eligibility

If you are {ref}`manually bootstrapping <manual-bootstrapping>` a cluster, any
nodes you {ref}`list as master-eligible <master-node-election>` must have a
[node.master] value of `true`. This is the default value.

(inter-node-comms)=

### Inter-node communication

By default, CrateDB nodes communicate with each other on port `4300`. This
port is known as the *transport port*, and it must be accessible from every
node.

If you prefer, you can specify a port range instead of a single port number.
Edit the [transport.tcp.port] setting in your [configuration] file:

```yaml
transport.tcp.port: 4350-4360
```

:::{TIP}
If you are running a node on Docker, you can configure CrateDB to publish the
container's external hostname and the external port number bound to the
transport port. You can do that in your [configuration] file using the
[network.publish_host] and [transport.publish_port] settings.

For example:

```yaml
# External access
network.publish_host: node-01.example.com
transport.publish_port: 4321
```
:::

:::{SEEALSO}
{ref}`More information about port settings <crate-reference:conf_ports>`
:::

## CrateDB 3.x

CrateDB (versions 4.x and above) will automatically determine the ideal [quorum
size][quorum size], but if you are using CrateDB versions 3.x and below, you
must manually set the quorum size using the [discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes]
setting. For a three-node cluster, you must declare all nodes to be master-eligible.

If you are using CrateDB 3.x or below, to configure every node with a list of
seed nodes, you can use the [discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts] setting instead
of {ref}`crate-reference:discovery.seed_hosts`.
