# Installation and Configuration

## The Preferred Way (pip)

On any system you can install parso directly from the Python package index using pip:

```bash
sudo pip install parso
```

## From Git

If you want to install the current development version (master branch):

```bash
sudo pip install -e git+https://github.com/davidhalter/parso.git#egg=parso
```

## Manual Installation from a Downloaded Package

> Note: This method is not recommended.

If you prefer not to use an automated package installer, you can [download](https://github.com/davidhalter/parso/archive/master.zip) a current copy of parso and install it manually.

To install it, navigate to the directory containing `setup.py` on your console and type:

```bash
sudo python setup.py install
```
