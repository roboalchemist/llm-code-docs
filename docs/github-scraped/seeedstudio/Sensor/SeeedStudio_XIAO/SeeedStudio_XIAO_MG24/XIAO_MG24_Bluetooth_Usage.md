The Seeed Studio XIAO MG24 is a robust development board that supports Bluetooth LE 5.3 and Bluetooth mesh, making it an ideal choice for a wide array of IoT applications requiring wireless connectivity. Leveraging its exceptional RF performance, the XIAO MG24 delivers reliable, high-speed wireless communication over various distances, making it a versatile solution for both short-range and long-range applications. In this tutorial, we will explore the fundamental features of the XIAO MG24's Bluetooth capabilities, including how to scan for nearby Bluetooth devices, establish a Bluetooth connection, and transmit and receive data over that connection.

## Method for switching antennas

The Seeed Studio XIAO MG24 has two antenna options: an internal antenna and an external antenna. For convenience, you can choose to use the internal antenna, and to enhance signal strength, you can opt for the external antenna. Below are the method for switching between the two antennas.

PB04 is used to select between using the built-in antenna or an external antenna. Before that, you need to set PB05 high level to turn on this function. If PB04 is set low level, it uses the built-in antenna; if it set to high level, it uses the external antenna. Default is low level. If you want to set it high, you can refer the code below.
```cpp
#define RF_SW_PW_PIN PB5
#define RF_SW_PIN PB4

void setup() {
  // turn on this antenna function
  pinMode(RF_SW_PW_PIN, OUTPUT);  
  digitalWrite(RF_SW_PW_PIN, HIGH);

  delay(100);

  // HIGH -> Use external antenna / LOW -> Use built-in antenna
  pinMode(RF_SW_PIN, OUTPUT);  
  digitalWrite(RF_SW_PIN, HIGH);
```

## Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Usage

Bluetooth Low Energy, BLE for short, is a power-conserving variant of Bluetooth. BLE’s primary application is short distance transmission of small amounts of data (low bandwidth). Unlike Bluetooth that is always on, BLE remains in sleep mode constantly except for when a connection is initiated.

Due to its properties, BLE is suitable for applications that need to exchange small amounts of data periodically running on a coin cell. For example, BLE is of great use in healthcare, fitness, tracking, beacons, security, and home automation industries.

This makes it consume very low power. BLE consumes approximately 100x less power than Bluetooth (depending on the use case).

About the BLE part of XIAO MG24, we will introduce its use in the following sections.

- [Some fundamental concepts](#some-fundamental-concepts) -- We will first get to know some concepts that may be used frequently in BLE in order to help us understand the execution process and thinking of BLE programs.
- [BLE Scanner](#ble-scanner) -- This section will explain how to search for nearby Bluetooth devices and print them out in the serial monitor.
- [BLE server/client](#ble-serverclient) -- This section will explain how to use XIAO MG24 as Server and Client to send and receive specified data messages. It will also use to receive or send messages from the phone to XIAO.
<!-- - [BLE Sensor Data Exchange](#ble-sensor-data-exchange) -- This is the last section of the full tutorial where we will go through a sensor example to explain how to send the sensor data through BLE. -->

### Some fundamental concepts

#### Server and Client

With Bluetooth Low Energy, there are two types of devices: the server and the client. The XIAO MG24 can act either as a client or as a server.

The server advertises its existence, so it can be found by other devices, and contains the data that the client can read. The client scans the nearby devices, and when it finds the server it is looking for, it establishes a connection and listens for incoming data. This is called point-to-point communication.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/XIAO_MG24/Bluetooth/ble.png" style={{width:800, height:'auto'}}/></div>

#### Attribute

Attribute is actually a piece of data. Each Bluetooth device is used to provide a service, and the service is a collection of data, the collection can be called a database, each entry in the database is an Attribute, so here I translate Attribute into data entries. You can imagine a Bluetooth device as a table, each row inside the table is an Attribute.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SeeedStudio-XIAO-ESP32S3/img/52.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div>

#### GATT

When two Bluetooth devices establish a connection, they need a protocol to determine how to communicate. GATT (Generic Attribute Profile) is such a protocol that defines how data is transmitted between Bluetooth devices.

In the GATT protocol, the functions and properties of a device are organized into structures called services, characteristics, and descriptors. A service represents a set of related functions and features provided by a device. Each service can include multiple characteristics, which define a certain property or behavior of the service, such as sensor data or control commands. Each characteristic has a unique identifier and a value, which can be read or written to communicate. Descriptors are used to describe metadata of characteristics, such as format and access permission of characteristic values.

By using the GATT protocol, Bluetooth devices can communicate in different application scenarios, such as transmitting sensor data or controlling remote devices.

#### BLE Characteristic

ATT, full name attribute protocol. In the end, ATT is composed of a group of ATT commands, that is, request and response commands, ATT is also the uppermost layer of the Bluetooth null packet, that is, ATT is where we analyze the Bluetooth packet the most.

ATT command, formally known as ATT PDU (Protocol Data Unit). It includes 4 categories: read, write, notify and indicate. These commands can be divided into two types: if it requires a response, then it will be followed by a request; on the contrary, if it only requires an ACK but not a response, then it will not be followed by a request. 

Service and Characteristic are defined in the GATT layer. The Service side provides the Service, the Service is the data, and the data is the attribute, and the Service and Characteristic are the logical presentation of the data, or the data that the user can see are eventually transformed into the Service and Characteristic.

Let's take a look at what the service and characteristic look like from a mobile perspective. nRF Connect is an application that shows us very visually how each packet should look like.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SeeedStudio-XIAO-ESP32S3/img/62.png" style={{width:400, height:'auto'}}/></div>

As you can see, in the Bluetooth specification, each specific Bluetooth application is composed of multiple Services, and each Service is composed of multiple Characteristics. A Characteristic consists of a UUID, Properties, and a Value.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SeeedStudio-XIAO-ESP32S3/img/50.png" style={{width:300, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Properties are used to describe the types and permissions of operations on a characteristic, such as whether it supports read, write, notify, and so on. This is similar to the four categories included in an ATT PDU.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SeeedStudio-XIAO-ESP32S3/img/51.png" style={{width:800, height:'auto'}}/></div>

#### UUID

Each service, characteristic and descriptor have an UUID (Universally Unique Identifier). An UUID is a unique 128-bit (16 bytes) number. For example:

```
ea094cbd-3695-4205-b32d-70c1dea93c35
```

There are shortened UUIDs for all types, services, and profiles specified in the [SIG (Bluetooth Special Interest Group)](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/services). But if your application needs its own UUID, you can generate it using this [UUID generator website](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/).

### BLE Scanner

Creating a XIAO MG24 BLE scanner is simple. The following is a sample program to create a scanner.

```cpp
/*
   BLE scan example

   The example scans for other BLE devices and prints out the address, RSSI, channel and name for each found device.

Now you can select XIAO MG24 motherboard and upload the program. If the program runs smoothly, open the serial monitor and set the baud rate to 115200, you can see the following result.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/XIAO_MG24/Bluetooth/scan_result.png" style={{width:700, height:'auto'}}/></div>

This program prints out the name, MAC address, Channel and signal of the scanned Bluetooth device.

#### Program annotation

This example demonstrates how to scan for nearby Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices using the Silicon Labs BLE stack, printing the address, RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator), channel, and name of each discovered device.

The code begins by defining an event handler function`sl_bt_on_event`, which processes various Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) events generated by the BLE stack. This function uses a switch statement to differentiate between event types, such as when the BLE device boots up and when it receives advertisement reports from nearby devices. Upon receiving the boot event, it initializes the serial communication, configures GPIO pins for antenna control, and starts scanning for BLE devices with specified parameters.

When the scanning process detects an advertisement report from a BLE device, the `sl_bt_evt_scanner_legacy_advertisement_report_id` case is triggered. In this case, the function increments a counter for each detected device and extracts key information, including the device's address, RSSI, channel, and local name. It utilizes the helper function `get_complete_local_name_from_ble_advertisement` to retrieve the complete name of the device from the advertisement data, which is then printed to the serial output.

The helper function`get_complete_local_name_from_ble_advertisement`, iterates through the advertisement data to locate the complete local name field. It checks each advertisement record for the type that corresponds to the complete local name and returns it as a string. If the complete name is not found, the function returns "N/A." This systematic approach allows the application to effectively discover and identify nearby BLE devices, providing valuable information during the scanning process.

### BLE server/client

As previously mentioned, XIAO MG24 can act as both a server and a client. Let's take a look at the program as a server and how to use it. After uploading the following program to XIAO, it will act as a server and send a "Hello World" message to all Bluetooth devices connected to XIAO.

```cpp
//Server Code
#define RF_SW_PW_PIN PB5
#define RF_SW_PIN PB4

bool notification_enabled = false;

void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LED_BUILTIN_INACTIVE);
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial.println("Silicon Labs BLE send hello world example");

  // turn on the antenna function
  pinMode(RF_SW_PW_PIN, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(RF_SW_PW_PIN, HIGH);

  delay(100);

  // HIGH -> Use external antenna / LOW -> Use built-in antenna
  pinMode(RF_SW_PIN, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(RF_SW_PIN, LOW);
}

void loop() {
  if (notification_enabled) {
    // Send a notification every two seconds with the message 'hello world'
    send_helloworld_notification();
  }
  delay(2000);
}

The above program will turn XIAO into a client and search for nearby Bluetooth devices. When the UUID of the Bluetooth device matches the UUID you provided, it will connect to the device and obtain its characteristic value.

#### Program annotation

Let’s take a quick look at how the BLE server example code works. It starts by importing the necessary libraries for the BLE capabilities. Then, you need to define a UUID for the Service and Characteristic.

```c
// Add my BLE service to the GATT DB
// UUID: de8a5aac-a99b-c315-0c80-60d4cbb51224
const uuid_128 my_service_uuid = {
  .data = { 0x24, 0x12, 0xb5, 0xcb, 0xd4, 0x60, 0x80, 0x0c, 0x15, 0xc3, 0x9b, 0xa9, 0xac, 0x5a, 0x8a, 0xde }
};

// Add the 'Notify' characteristic to my BLE service
// UUID: 61a885a4-41c3-60d0-9a53-6d652a70d29c
const uuid_128 btn_report_characteristic_uuid = {
  .data = { 0x9c, 0xd2, 0x70, 0x2a, 0x65, 0x6d, 0x53, 0x9a, 0xd0, 0x60, 0xc3, 0x41, 0xa4, 0x85, 0xa8, 0x61 }
};
```

You can leave the default UUIDs, or you can go to [uuidgenerator.net](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/) to create random UUIDs for your services and characteristics.

Then, you create a BLE device called “XIAO_MG24 Server”. You can change this name to whatever you like. In the following line, you set the BLE device as a server. After that, you create a service for the BLE server with the UUID defined earlier.

```c
sl_status_t sc;

Then, you set the characteristic for that service. As you can see, you also use the UUID defined earlier, and you need to pass as arguments the characteristic’s properties. In this case, it’s: READ and NOTIFY.

```c
// Add the 'Notify' characteristic to my BLE service
// UUID: 61a885a4-41c3-60d0-9a53-6d652a70d29c
const uuid_128 btn_report_characteristic_uuid = {
  .data = { 0x9c, 0xd2, 0x70, 0x2a, 0x65, 0x6d, 0x53, 0x9a, 0xd0, 0x60, 0xc3, 0x41, 0xa4, 0x85, 0xa8, 0x61 }
};
uint8_t notify_char_init_value = 0;
sc = sl_bt_gattdb_add_uuid128_characteristic(gattdb_session_id,
                                              my_service_handle,
                                              SL_BT_GATTDB_CHARACTERISTIC_READ | SL_BT_GATTDB_CHARACTERISTIC_NOTIFY,
                                              0x00,
                                              0x00,
                                              btn_report_characteristic_uuid,
                                              sl_bt_gattdb_fixed_length_value,
                                              1,                               // max length
                                              sizeof(notify_char_init_value),  // initial value length
                                              &notify_char_init_value,         // initial value
                                              &notify_characteristic_handle);

// Start my BLE service
sc = sl_bt_gattdb_start_service(gattdb_session_id, my_service_handle);
app_assert_status(sc);

// Commit the GATT DB changes
sc = sl_bt_gattdb_commit(gattdb_session_id);
app_assert_status(sc);
```

After creating the characteristic, you can set its value with the `sl_bt_gatt_server_notify_all()` method. In this case we’re setting the value to the text “Hello World”. You can change this text to whatever your like. In future projects, this text can be a sensor reading, or the state of a lamp, for example.

Finally, you can start the service, and the advertising, so other BLE devices can scan and find this BLE device.

```c
// Start advertising
ble_start_advertising();
```

This is just a simple example on how to create a BLE server. The function of this program is to send notifications every two seconds, with the content being "Hello World".



### BLE Sensor Data Exchange

Next, we'll come to the real world to complete a case. In this case, we will use the function `getCPUTemp()` of XIAO MG24 to measure the temperature of the current MCU, and then send the temperature value of the MCU to another XIAO MG24 via Bluetooth to simulate a health thermometer.

We need to prepare two XIAO, one as server and one as client. Here is the sample program as a server. XIAO as a server has the following main tasks. 
- First, use the function `getCPUTemp()` to get the current temperature of MCU; 
- Second, create the Bluetooth server; 
- Third, advertise the temperature values through Bluetooth; 
- Fourth, show the real-time temperature.

```c
// server

/*
   BLE health thermometer example

   The example implements a minimal BLE Health Thermometer profile to provide temperature measurements over BLE

   On startup the sketch will start a BLE advertisement with the configured name, then
   it will accept any incoming connection. When a device is connected and enables indications for the
   health thermometer characteristic, then the device will send it's CPU temperature readings as thermometer data.
   With the EFR Connect app you can test this functionality by going to the "Demo" tab and selecting "Health Thermometer".
   Alternatively, you can test this example by flashing an other BLE board with the 'ble_health_thermometer_client' demo
   and have the two boards exchange the temperature measurements over BLE.

   Find out more on the API usage at: https://docs.silabs.com/bluetooth/latest/bluetooth-stack-api/

   This example only works with the 'BLE (Silabs)' protocol stack variant.

   You can test the thermometer device with the EFR Connect app:

After uploading the program for one of the XIAO, if the program runs smoothly, then you can take out your phone and use the nRF Connect APP to search for the Bluetooth device named **XIAOMG24_BLE**, connect it, and click the button shown below, you will receive the temperature data information.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/XIAO_MG24/Bluetooth/BLEServer-5.jpg" style={{width:300, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Next, we need to take out our other XIAO, which acts as a client to collect and display our data.

```c
// client

/*
   BLE health thermometer client example

   The example connects to another board running the 'BLE Health Thermometer' example and reads the temperature through BLE

   On startup the sketch will start a scanning for the other board running the 'ble_health_thermometer' example and
   advertising as "Thermometer Example". Once the other board is found, it establishes a connection,
   discovers it's services and characteristics, then subscribes to the temperature measurements.
   After the subscription the example starts receiving the temperature data from the other board periodically,
   and prints it to Serial.

   Find out more on the API usage at: https://docs.silabs.com/bluetooth/latest/bluetooth-stack-api/

   This example only works with the 'BLE (Silabs)' protocol stack variant.

Finally, if the Server and Client programs run smoothly, you can see the following information printed by the Client through the serial port.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/XIAO_MG24/Bluetooth/BLEClient_result-1.png" style={{width:700, height:'auto'}}/></div>

#### Program annotation

For the above programs, we will pick the more important parts to explain. We'll start with the server program.

At the beginning of the program, we define the name of the Bluetooth server, this name can be the name you set, but you need to remember it because you need to rely on this name to search for this Bluetooth device.

```c
const uint8_t advertised_name[] = "XIAOMG24_BLE";
```

In the previous sections of the tutorial, we have talked about that under the server there will be Characteristic, and under Characteristic there will be the values and the rest of the content. So we need to follow this one principle when we create ads.

```c
// Health Thermometer service
const uint8_t thermometer_service_uuid[] = { 0x09, 0x18 };
sc = sl_bt_gattdb_add_service(gattdb_session_id,
                              sl_bt_gattdb_primary_service,
                              SL_BT_GATTDB_ADVERTISED_SERVICE,
                              sizeof(thermometer_service_uuid),
                              thermometer_service_uuid,
                              &service_handle);
app_assert_status(sc);

// Temperature Measurement characteristic
const sl_bt_uuid_16_t temp_measurement_characteristic_uuid = { .data = { 0x1C, 0x2A } };
uint8_t temp_initial_value[5] = { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };
sc = sl_bt_gattdb_add_uuid16_characteristic(gattdb_session_id,
                                            service_handle,
                                            SL_BT_GATTDB_CHARACTERISTIC_INDICATE,
                                            0x00,
                                            0x00,
                                            temp_measurement_characteristic_uuid,
                                            sl_bt_gattdb_fixed_length_value,
                                            5,
                                            5,
                                            temp_initial_value,
                                            &temp_measurement_characteristic_handle);
app_assert_status(sc);
```

In the above program, you can see that `sl_bt_gattdb_add_service()` is used to create a server. The parameter is a specific UUID: **0x1809**. In the rules of GATT, **0x1809** indicates the thermometer type data, and the UUID of the same Characteristic: **0x2A1C** also has a special meaning. In GATT, it indicates the  temperature measurement. This fits the case of our temperature values, so here I am defining it as such. You can read [here](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SeeedStudio-XIAO-ESP32S3/res/GATT.pdf) what some of the specific UUIDs that GATT has prepared for us mean.

Of course, you can also set the UUIDs without following the GATT standard, you just need to make sure that these two values are unique and will not affect your client's ability to find the values by recognizing these UUIDs. You can go to [uuidgenerator.net](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/) to create random UUIDs for your services and characteristics.

Finally, we measure and advertise the temperature value of the MCU once per second in the `loop`.

The next step is the Client program, which will seem much more complicated.

At the beginning of the program, it's still very familiar content. You need to make sure that this content is consistent with what you have configured on the server side.

```c
const uint8_t thermometer_service_uuid[] = { 0x09, 0x18 };
const sl_bt_uuid_16_t temp_measurement_characteristic_uuid = { .data = { 0x1C, 0x2A } };
const uint8_t advertised_name[] = "XIAOMG24_BLE";
```

Next, we will write a Bluetooth stack event handler function, which mainly handles callback tasks triggered by various Bluetooth events, including initialization of Bluetooth devices, connection and disconnection of Bluetooth, and searching for nearby Bluetooth devices.

```c
/**************************************************************************//**
 * Bluetooth stack event handler
 * Called when an event happens on BLE the stack
 *
 * @param[in] evt Event coming from the Bluetooth stack
 *****************************************************************************/
void sl_bt_on_event(sl_bt_msg_t *evt)
```

The following process is the key to finding temperature values in the server. Firstly, after we successfully locate our server UUID and find the characteristic UUID under the server, we will process the obtained data, as shown in the following code snippet. Finally, print out the processed data through the serial port. This parsing method is a one-to-one correspondence with the data structure of Bluetooth.

```c
void sl_bt_on_event(sl_bt_msg_t *evt)
{
  sl_status_t sc;

  switch (SL_BT_MSG_ID(evt->header)) {
    
    ...

    // This event is received when a characteristic value was received (like an indication)
    case sl_bt_evt_gatt_characteristic_value_id:
    {
      Serial.println("GATT data received");
      // Get the received data from the event
      uint8_t* char_value = &(evt->data.evt_gatt_characteristic_value.value.data[0]);
      // Convert it back to float
      float temperature = translate_IEEE_11073_temperature_to_float((IEEE_11073_float *)(char_value + 1));
      // Print to Serial
      Serial.print("Received temperature: ");
      Serial.print(temperature);
      Serial.println(" C");

      sc = sl_bt_gatt_send_characteristic_confirmation(evt->data.evt_gatt_characteristic_value.connection);
      app_assert_status(sc);
    }
    break;

    ...
  
  }
}
```
