<br />

### Years of Battery Life

**T2000-A / T2000-B**  
Built with a 8000 mAh battery, allowing them to operate for over one year when using GNSS with hourly uplinks. With longer uplink intervals, their battery life can extend up to 7~9 years, providing long-term reliability for various deployment scenarios.

**T2000-C (with Solar Panel)**  
Equipped with a 0.5 W solar panel and a 4000 mAh rechargeable battery, the T2000-C supports multi-year, low-maintenance operation under regular sunlight and moderate uplink intervals.

*Actual battery life varies with uplink interval, positioning mode, and deployment environment. Use the [Battery Life Calculator](https://files.seeedstudio.com/products/SenseCAP/T2000_Tracker/SenseCAP_Trcaker_Battery_Life_Calculator_T2000.xlsx) for details.

<br />

### Active Safety

- **Anti-Tamper Alert**: Once installed, the rear anti-tamper button remains engaged. The moment the device is removed, it instantly triggers a top-priority alarm to protect your core assets.
- **Vibration & Movement Detection**: Built-in 3-axis accelerometer, monitoring for suspicious activity in real-time, preventing incidents before they escalate.
- **Instant Notifications**: Delivers critical alerts directly to your phone within seconds, empowering you to act immediately.

<br />

### Offline Data Storage

The device features robust local storage, capable of securely holding up to 1,000 data records. Even if the LoRaWAN network becomes temporarily unavailable, it continues logging data without interruption.

Assuming the device remains continuously out of LoRaWAN coverage,

- At an uplink interval of 1 hour, it can retain approximately up to 41 days of historical data.
- At an uplink interval of 12 hours, it can store over 500 days of historical data.
- At an uplink interval of 24 hours, it can retain more than 1000 days of historical data.

Once the device moves back into an area with LoRaWAN coverage, it will automatically transmit all previously stored records, ensuring that your data remains complete and never gets lost.
