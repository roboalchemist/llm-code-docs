The **AmazingHand** is an open-source robotic hand project designed to make research and experimentation with humanoid manipulation accessible and affordable. Traditional robotic hands are often prohibitively expensive and rely on complex, bulky forearm actuators. The AmazingHand solves this by integrating all its motors directly into a compact, 3D-printable design.

Its design is inspired by the "ILDA hand" research project but simplified to lower the barrier to entry for students, hobbyists, and researchers. The wrist interface is designed for the Reachy2 robot but can be easily adapted for any platform.

## Key Features & Specifications

The AmazingHand packs impressive capabilities into a lightweight and accessible package.

| Feature               | Specification                                                              |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Degrees of Freedom**| **8-DOF** (4 fingers, 2-DOF per finger)                                    |
| **Actuation** | Parallel mechanism with 2x Feetech SCS0009 servos per finger               |
| **Motion** | Flexion/Extension & Abduction/Adduction via differential motor movement    |
| **Construction** | Fully 3D printable with rigid "bones" and flexible TPU shells              |
| **Weight** | \~400g                                                                      |
| **Control Interface** | Serial bus           |
| **License** | Code: **Apache 2.0**, Mechanical Design: **CC BY 4.0** |

Each finger is actuated by two motors in parallel. This clever design allows for both curling (flexion/extension) and side-to-side (abduction/adduction) movements by controlling the differential motion of the servos. The palm is also a flexible part, allowing for safer and more compliant grasping of objects.

- **Assembly Guide:** A detailed, step-by-step guide to assemble the hand.

  - [**Assembly Guide PDF**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pollen-robotics/AmazingHand/main/docs/AmazingHand_Assembly.pdf)

## Control Methods

You have two primary options for controlling the hand's servos over the serial bus.

1. **MPU:** Use a Python script on a host computer (like a Raspberry Pi or PC) connected via a serial bus driver (e.g., [Bus Servo Driver Board](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Bus-Servo-Driver-Board-for-XIAO-p-6413.html) ). This is great for integration with larger robotics frameworks like ROS.

2. **MCU:** Use an microcontroller like Arduino with a  [Bus Servo Driver Board](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Bus-Servo-Driver-Board-for-XIAO-p-6413.html). This is ideal for standalone projects or when a dedicated microcontroller is preferred for handling real-time control.

Calibration scripts are provided for both methods to help you set up the fingers correctly during assembly.

## Running the Demos

Once assembled, you can test your AmazingHand with the provided demo programs.

:::caution[External Power Required]
The eight servos in the hand require a stable power source. A simple 5V / 2A DC adapter with a jack connector is sufficient. **Do not try to power the servos directly from your computer's USB port.**
:::

### Basic Demos

Once assembled, you can test your AmazingHand with the provided demo programs. First, clone the project repository to your computer to get all the necessary code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pollen-robotics/AmazingHand
cd AmazingHand
```

:::

#### Python Examples

The `PythonExample` directory contains several useful scripts for testing and control. Navigate into this directory (`cd PythonExample`) to run them.

- **`AmazingHand_Demo.py`**: This is the main demo. It cycles the hand through several pre-programmed gestures. It's the perfect first test to ensure everything is working correctly.
- **`AmazingHand_Demo_Both.py`**: A specific demo for controlling both a right and a left hand connected to the same serial bus.
- **`AmazingHand_FingerTest.py`**: A script to test the movement of a single finger, which is very useful for debugging during assembly.
- **`AmazingHand_Hand_FingerMiddlePos.py`**: A utility script used for calibration to set fingers to their neutral, middle position.

To run the main demo, execute the following command from within the `PythonExample` folder:

```bash
python3 AmazingHand_Demo.py
```

#### Arduino Examples

For standalone control, the `ArduinoExample` directory contains sketches you can upload directly to your microcontroller.

- **`Amazing_Hand_Demo.ino`**: The main demo sketch that cycles the hand through the same gestures as the Python version.
- **`Amazing_Hand-Finger_Test.ino`**: A simple sketch to test a single finger, useful for calibration and debugging hardware connections.

To use these, open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE, ensure you have the required `SCServo` library installed, then compile and upload it to your Arduino board.

### Strain Gauge Remote Control Demo

:::info 🖐️ Intuitive, Force-based Control
This advanced demo allows for intuitive, force-based control of the hand's grip and gestures.
:::

**Principle of Operation**

The core of this demo is to create a data glove that translates your finger movements into commands for the **AmazingHand**. We achieve this by leveraging the electrical property of **strain gauges**, which change their resistance when bent.

<div style={{
  maxWidth: '504px',
  margin: 'auto',
  border: '1px solid #ddd',
  borderRadius: '8px',
  overflow: 'hidden'
}}>
  <iframe
    src="https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7359424679310233601?compact=1"

    title="Embedded post"
    style={{
      display: 'block',
      width: '100%',
      height: '399px'
    }}>
  </iframe>
</div>

The workflow is as follows:

1. **Sensing Finger Bending**: We attach strain gauges to a glove or fingers. When you bend your fingers, the strain gauges bend with them, causing a measurable change in their electrical resistance.

2. **Data Acquisition**: A **Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-S3** microcontroller is used to read these resistance changes. Each strain gauge circuit is connected to one of the ESP32's **Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)** pins, which converts the analog resistance signal into a digital number (typically from 0 to 4095).

3. **Serial Communication**: The ESP32 continuously sends these digital ADC readings over a USB serial port to a host computer.

4. **Processing and Mapping**: A Python script running on the host computer listens to the serial port, receiving the raw ADC values. It then maps these values from the ADC's range (0-4095) to the AmazingHand's desired servo angle range.

5. **Hand Control**: Finally, the script sends the calculated target angles to the AmazingHand's controller, causing the robotic fingers to mirror the movements of your own fingers in real-time.

This creates a complete closed-loop system where your physical hand gestures directly command the robotic hand.

To run this demo, you need to flash the data acquisition firmware onto the ESP32 and run the Python control script on your host computer.

1. XIAO ESP32-S3 Firmware

This firmware is responsible for reading the values from the strain gauges connected to the ADC pins and sending them over the serial port in the format "value1,value2".

```cpp title="XIAO_ESP32_S3_C3_Firmware.ino"

### MediaPipe Hand Tracking Demo

Control the robotic hand in real-time by mirroring the movements of your own hand, tracked using a simple webcam and Google's MediaPipe framework. This advanced demo uses a Python backend to run the complex hand-tracking AI model, while a simple HTML frontend captures your camera feed. The two communicate over a WebSocket, allowing for smooth, low-latency control of the AmazingHand just by showing your hand to the camera.

<div style={{
  position: 'relative',
  paddingBottom: '56.25%', // 16:9 aspect ratio
  height: 0,
  overflow: 'hidden',
}}>
  <div class="video-container">

    style={{
      position: 'absolute',

  </div>
</div>

To get this demo running, you will need two files: `index.html` for the browser interface and `backend.py` for the server-side processing.

**Step 1: Save the Code Files**

First, create the two required files in the same directory. Copy the HTML code into a file named `index.html`, and copy the Python code into a file named `backend.py`.

- **`index.html`**: This file creates the simple web page that requests access to your webcam and streams the video to the backend.
- **`backend.py`**: This script launches a local WebSocket server. It receives the video stream, uses the MediaPipe library to detect hand landmarks in each frame, and then translates those landmark positions into motor commands for the AmazingHand.

**Step 2: Run the Backend Server**

Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the files, and run the following command to start the Python server:

```bash
python backend.py
```

You should see a message in the terminal indicating that the server has started and is waiting for a connection, for example: `WebSocket server started on ws://localhost:8765`.

**Step 3: Launch the Frontend**

Finally, navigate to the same directory in your file explorer and double-click the `index.html` file. It will open in your default web browser. The browser will likely ask for permission to use your webcam; please allow it.

Once the page loads, you will see your camera feed. The Python script will begin processing the video, and you can control the AmazingHand by moving your hand in front of the camera.
