<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCraft_AI/img2/5.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

## Training

The Training section of the SenseCraft AI website is designed to help users create customized models tailored to their specific use cases. Currently, the Training page offers two types of training: Classification and Object Detection.

### Classification

The Classification training is based on TensorFlow and is fully web-based, eliminating any operating system limitations. This feature allows users to train models using images captured from their local computer's camera or Seeed Studio products. To train a model, users only need to collect 40-50 images per class, without the need for manual labeling. The training process is quick, taking only a few minutes to generate a model. Additionally, the web interface provides real-time preview functionality, enabling users to see the results of their trained model instantly.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCraft_AI/img2/6.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

### Object Detection

The Object Detection training is based on the YOLO-World model and is divided into two sub-sections: **Quick Training** and **Image Collection Training**.

- **Quick Training**: This option allows users to generate a single-class recognition model by simply inputting the object name. As explained on the website, "Based on YOLO - World object detection model, you can quickly generate a single-class recognition model by inputting text."

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCraft_AI/img2/7.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

The Quick Training option under the Object Detection training is powered by the YOLO-World object detection model, which is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. When a user inputs an object name, the system leverages the pre-trained knowledge of the YOLO-World model to generate a single-class recognition model specifically tailored to detect that object.

The YOLO (You Only Look Once) model family is known for its speed and accuracy in object detection tasks. It divides the input image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell. The YOLO-World model, in particular, has been trained on a vast dataset covering a wide range of objects, enabling it to generalize well to various detection tasks.

By building upon the YOLO-World model, the Quick Training option inherits its robust feature extraction and object localization capabilities. The pre-trained model serves as a strong foundation, allowing users to quickly generate a single-class recognition model without the need for extensive training data or computational resources.

However, it is important to acknowledge that the Quick Training option may have limitations in terms of adaptability and precision. As the generated model relies on the pre-existing knowledge of the YOLO-World model, it may not always capture the unique characteristics or variations of the user-specified object. This can lead to reduced accuracy or false detections in certain scenarios.

- **Image Collection Training**: This option requires users to input the object name and upload relevant images. The website describes this feature as follows: "Based on YOLO - World object detection model, you can customize the training for text and image, which can improve the detection accuracy of the generated model."

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCraft_AI/img2/8.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

The Image Collection Training option in SenseCraft AI allows users to train a custom object detection model using their own dataset, without the need for manual image annotation. This feature is based on the YOLO-World object detection model and utilizes a specialized training approach that eliminates the requirement for bounding box labeling or object segmentation.

The key principle behind this training option is the concept of weakly supervised learning. In weakly supervised learning, the model learns to detect objects using only image-level labels, without the need for precise object localization or bounding box annotations. The YOLO-World model, which serves as the foundation for Image Collection Training, has been designed to leverage this approach effectively.

During the training process, users provide a set of images along with the corresponding object names they want to detect. The model then learns to associate the visual patterns and features present in the images with the provided object names. By exposing the model to a diverse range of images containing the objects of interest, it learns to generalize and detect those objects in new, unseen images.

The YOLO-World model's architecture and training methodology enable it to automatically discover and localize objects within the images, without the need for explicit bounding box annotations. This is achieved through a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and specialized loss functions that guide the model to focus on the most informative regions of the images.

By eliminating the need for manual image annotation, the Image Collection Training option significantly reduces the effort and time required to create a custom object detection model. Users can simply collect a dataset of images containing the objects they want to detect, provide the object names, and let the model learn to recognize those objects automatically.

However, it's important to note that the quality and diversity of the dataset still play a crucial role in the performance of the resulting model. The model's ability to generalize and detect objects accurately depends on the variety and representativeness of the training images. Users should strive to collect a dataset that covers different object appearances, poses, backgrounds, and lighting conditions to ensure robust performance.

By providing these two training options, SenseCraft AI enables users to create custom object detection models that are optimized for their specific needs. The Quick Training option is ideal for users who need a simple, single-class recognition model and want to generate it quickly. On the other hand, the Image Collection Training option is suitable for users who require a more accurate and customized model, as it allows them to provide their own training data in the form of object names and images.

## Vision Workspace

The Vision Workspace section of SenseCraft AI is dedicated to device-specific operations and deployment of trained models. It provides a seamless interface for users to integrate their custom models with various hardware devices and preview the results in real-time. Currently, the supported devices include Grove Vision AI V2, XIAO ESP32S3 Sense, NVIDIA Jetson, and reCamera.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCraft_AI/img2/9.png" style={{width:400, height:'auto'}}/></div>

### Model Deployment and Preview

Once a user has successfully uploaded a trained model, they can navigate to the device-specific page within the Vision Workspace. Under the "Process" section, users can observe the real-time detection feed from the connected device, allowing them to preview the model's performance in action.

This real-time preview feature is particularly valuable as it enables users to assess the model's accuracy and effectiveness in detecting objects within the device's video stream. Users can visually inspect the bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores generated by the model, providing immediate feedback on its performance.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCraft_AI/img2/10.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

### Model Fine-tuning

In addition to real-time preview, the Vision Workspace also offers the capability to fine-tune the model's confidence threshold parameter. This feature allows users to adjust the model's sensitivity to object detection, enabling them to strike a balance between precision and recall.

By manipulating the confidence threshold, users can control the model's behavior in terms of detecting objects. A higher confidence threshold will result in the model being more selective, only detecting objects with a high degree of certainty. Conversely, a lower confidence threshold will make the model more sensitive, detecting objects even with lower confidence scores.

This fine-tuning capability empowers users to adapt the model to their specific requirements, optimizing its performance based on the characteristics of their application and the environment in which the device operates.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCraft_AI/img2/11.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

### Output and Application Development

The Vision Workspace goes beyond model deployment and preview by providing users with the tools to quickly prototype and develop applications using the trained models. The "Output" section offers a range of options for users to interact with the model's results and integrate them into their desired applications.

Taking the XIAO ESP32S3 Sense as an example, the Vision Workspace supports various communication protocols and interfaces, such as MQTT, GPIO, and Serial Port. These options enable users to seamlessly transmit the model's output to other systems, trigger actions based on object detection, or perform further processing on the detected results.

By offering these output options, SenseCraft AI simplifies the process of integrating the trained models into practical applications. Users can quickly experiment with different communication methods and develop prototypes that leverage the object detection capabilities of their models.

For instance, a user could utilize the MQTT output to send real-time object detection data to a remote server for monitoring or analytics purposes. Alternatively, they could use the GPIO output to trigger physical actions, such as turning on a light or activating an alarm based on the presence of specific objects.

The Serial Port output provides a straightforward way to establish communication between the device and other systems, enabling users to transmit the model's results for further processing or visualization.
