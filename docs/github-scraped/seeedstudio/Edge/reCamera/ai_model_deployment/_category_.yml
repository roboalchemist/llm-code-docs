  title: Overview of AI model Deployment
  description: This section offers a concise overview of the AI model training, fine-tuning, and deployment processes for reCamera. It begins with model selection, discussing options like YOLO v5/v8/11 and the criteria for choosing the appropriate model based on different scenarios, with current typical models and available frameworks. Then, it touches on parameter configuration, followed by the complex procedures of model format conversion, which involves model adaptation and middleware translation. Subsequently, it covers model quantization and compression. Finally, it addresses the deployment and testing phases, including considerations for post-processing.
