# Develop reCamera with Node-RED

## Node-RED Introduction

Node-RED's goal is to enable anyone to build applications that collect, transform and visualize their data; building flows that can automate their world. Its low-code nature makes it accessible to users of any background, whether for home automation, industrial control systems or anything in between. By integrated Node-RED with reCamera, it provides a beginner-friendly development method that can let users drag and play with the device right the way.

You can learn the [Node-RED Concept](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/concepts#:~:text=A%20Flow%20is%20represented%20as,(sets%20of%20connected%20nodes).) here or start with a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFNv91TTt68).

On reCamera, we have installed palette for Node-RED, which includes the following:

- SSCMA Palette (All OS version)
- Dashboard Palette (All OS version)
- reCamera Hardware (0.1.6 OS and above)

With other palette in Node-RED by default, such as function, debug, trigger, mqtt and so on, you can now use them to build your flows to achieve different computer vision applications.

## Import Flow to reCamera

There are two ways to import flow to reCamera:

- Import flow from local file or json.
  - Step1: Click on the `menu icon` in the upper right corner and select "Import".
    <div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/import_flow_1.png" /></div>

  - Step2: Click on the "Import" tab.
    <div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/import_flow_2.png" /></div>

  - Step3: Either paste the flow json code or upload the flow json file. You can find flows in the community or [github](https://github.com/jby5122/OSHW-reCamera-Series/tree/main/Node-RED_Flow) for useable flows and integrated them with reCamera.

  - Step4: Click on the "Import" button.
  
- Import flow from SenseCraft reCamera [public applications](https://sensecraft.seeed.cc/ai/#/recamera).

  - Step1: Find any interesting flow in the public applications. Then click `clone`.
    <div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/sensecraft_clone.png" /></div>

  - Step2: Choose your connect method to reCamera either via USB or Network. If you are using network connection, please enter the correct IP for reCamera in the text box then click connect.

  - Step3: The public application will be auto imported to reCamera. You can also contribute your flow to the community to make the platform more inspired to other users.

## Deploy Flow to reCamera

Once you add, delete, or change nodes and wires in the workspace, please make sure you click the `Deploy` button in the upper right corner to deploy the newest flow to reCamera.

## SSCMA Palette

<div align="center"><img width={200} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/sscma_palette.png" /></div>

`node-red-contrib-sscma` is a Node-RED node component designed to facilitate the quick deployment of AI models through flow-based programming. `sscma` is short for Seeed SenseCraft Model Assistant. This allows for seamless integration of AI model outputs with other devices, enabling smart automation and intelligent workflows.

### Installation

This palette is installed by default when you install Node-RED. If you want to install it manually, you can follow the steps below:

1. Access to Node-RED Workspace by visiting `ip_address/#/workspace`.
2. Click on the `menu icon` in the upper right corner and select "Manage Palette."
3. Click on the "Install" tab.
4. In the search bar, enter "node-red-contrib-sscma" and click on the "Install" button.
5. Wait for the installation to complete. Please note that because the device limitation, the downloading time will be around 30 seconds to 5 minutes depends on the network speed.

### Camera Node

<div align="center"><img width={200} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/camera_node.png" /></div>

This node is used to enable the camera. It can be used to capture the stream of the camera module.

#### Configuration

When first dragging out the node, you will see the following:

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/add_camera_node.png" /></div>

The audio selection means if you want the video stream to ouput with audio or not, and the volume of audio is adjustable. The red triangle on node means the node needs a client to connect with it. You can click on `add icon` to add a SSCMA client.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/new_sscma_config_node.png" /></div>

Then you can add the `sscma config` node by hitting the upper right corner "Add" button with the following default parameters. This config node is only neeeded once for other nodes like model node and so on. After the client is selected, the red triangle will be gone.

#### Input and Output

You can also input parameters to control whether the camera is on or not by parsing `msg.enabled = true` or `msg.enabled = false` to the node. An example will be using time trigger node to enable the camera at specific time to make a power-efficient camera. (Only with OS version 0.1.5 and above)

Camera node can wire to `stream` node for RTSP, `preview` node or `model` node for computer vision processing.

### Model Node

This model node enables reCamera to load different vision AI models such as Yolo and adjust the parameters of the model.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/model_node.png" /></div>

#### Configuration

Please also select `sscma` for the client. After selecting, the red triangle will be gone.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/select_sscma_node.png" /></div>

#### Model Selection

There are 3 ways to deploy different models on reCamera:

- 1. Choose `On Device` model. Several Yolo models are in the reCamera [by default](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/recamera_on_device_models).
- 2. Select models from `SenseCraft Zoo`. There are several public models to choose such as gesture and fruits. Users can also upload their own models, and make it public to contribute the community.
- 3. `Upload your own model` to reCamera. By following the instruction for [converting model to reCamera](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/recamera_model_conversion/), users can convert their own AI models to INT8 cvimodel format to adapt to reCamera. Then upload the model to reCamera for deployment. After the model is uploaded, please list the classies of the model in the `Labels` field.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/model_classes.png" /></div>

#### Model parameters

The `Confidence` slider is used to set the confidence for AI model. Confidence refers to the probability or certainty that a model assigns to a particular prediction. it also provides a confidence score ranging from 0 to 1. A higher confidence indicates that the model will filter out less confident predictions.

The `IoU` slider is used to set the IoU for AI model. IoU is a metric used to measure the overlap between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth bounding box in object detection tasks. It is calculated as the ratio of the intersection area of the two boxes to their union area. The IoU value ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 means no overlap and 1 means a perfect match. A higher IoU threshold (e.g., 0.5 or 0.7) indicates a stricter requirement for a correct detection.

#### Output

The `base64 image ouput` tickbox is used to set if you want the base64 image code to be output with other parameters or not.

The `Trace` tickbox is used to enable the tracking mode. When the tracking mode is enabled, the detected object will be assigned ID.

The `Counting` tickbox is used to enable the counting mode. When the counting mode is enabled, the node will output the counting information to the console.

The `Splitter` field is used to set the counting line. Draw any line in the box to count the number of objects that cross the line.

Wire model node to a debug node to see the output. Please
Output object example for Yolo 11n:

```
{
  boxes: [
    0: box_center_x,
    1: box_center_y,
    2: box_width,
    3: box_height,
    4: detected object score,
    5: detected object class ID,
  ],
  count: //inference numbers ,
  image: //base64 image code,
  labels: [
    0: class name // e.g. person
  ],
  perf: [
    0: 0 fps, //pre-processing fps
    1: 40 ms, //inference time
    2: 20 ms, //post-processing time
  ],
  resolution: [ //pixel size of the image
    0: 640,
    1: 640,
  ]
}
```

Model node can be wired to `preview` node to preview effect in the Node-RED workspace. You can also parse the output to other nodes for further processing such as `function node`, `mqtt node`, `debug node` or other nodes in the `Dashboard UI Palette`.

### Preview Node

This node is used to enable the preview of the camera module. It can be used to preview the video stream of the camera module. You can use the green toogle to enable or disable the preview. Please note that because of the device CPU limit, **do not** drag out too many preview nodes and debug nodes at the same time as CPU load will be heavier when printing the debug information to the console.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/preview_node.png" /></div>

### Stream Node

This node is used to enable the streaming of the camera module. It can be used to stream the video stream of the camera module to the server.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/stream_node.png" /></div>

#### Configuration

Please also select `sscma` for the client. After selecting, the red triangle will be gone.

#### Input and Output

Input: Wire the `camera` node to the `stream` node to enable the streaming.

Output:
You can then use other applications such as VLC to view the RTSP stream out from reCamera. As an example in the above screenshot, you can use `rtsp://admin:admin@192.168.42.1:554/live` in VLC then you can see the H.264 streaming video.

- Video parameter: 1920 *1800* 15fps by default.
- Latency: This is different based on what end applications you are using. E.g, VLC is 500 ms.  

:::note
Considering the stability of the device push stream, the highest configuration we recommend is 1080p@15fps video stream. This is also the default configuration.
If you want to set a different resolution, you can simply change the preset options by:

1. Enter the recamera backend terminal
2. Enter command `cd /home/recamera/.node-red/node_modules/node-red-contrib-sscma/nodes`
3. Enter command `sudo sed -i 's/option: n.option || 0,/option: n.option !== undefined ? parseInt(n.option) : 1,/' camera.js` set to 720p video.

`option: n.option !== undefined ? parseInt(n.option) : 1`

The numerical configuration relationship of the option settings is as follows:

```c++
if (option.find("1080p") != std::string::npos) {
            option_ = 0;
        } else if (option.find("720p") != std::string::npos) {
            option_ = 1;
        } else if (option.find("480p") != std::string::npos) {
            option_ = 2;
        }
```

For detailed information, please refer to the [following link](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/sscma-example-sg200x/blob/main/solutions/sscma-node/main/node/camera.cpp). The sscma-node node can be customized to meet your desired video resolution and frame rate.

It should be noted that modifying the source code requires you to have a solid foundation in C++ and be proficient in the technical stack for cross-compilation. Just modify the configuration of "default".

### Save Node

This node is used to enable the saving of the camera module. It can be used to save the video stream of the camera module.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/save_node.png" /></div>

#### Configuration

Please also select `sscma` for the client. After selecting, the red triangle will be gone.

#### Input

Input: Wire the `camera` node to the `save` node to enable the saving.

#### Save Parameters

Storage:

- Local -> path: `/userdata/VIDEO`
- External -> Stored in SD card.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/save_node_storage.png" /></div>

**Start tickbox**: Once ticked, the saving will start immediately. Saving parameter will based on the `slice` and `duration` below.

**Slice**: Video time length of each file you want to save. (You can change units in the dropdown menu with version 0.1.6 or above)

**Duration**: Total time length of the video you want to save.(You can change units in the dropdown menu with version 0.1.6 or above)

E.g. if slice is set to 5 minutes and duration is set to 1 hour, the video will be saved in 12 files with 5 minutes each.

### Example Flow with SSCMA Nodes

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/example_flow.png" /></div>

This flow is using Yolo 11n Detection model to preview the detected object in the workspace, and stream out the original video stream via RTSP.

## Dashboard UI Palette

[***Dashboard 2.0 paletter***](https://dashboard.flowfuse.com/getting-started.html) is made by ***Flowfuse*** based on the dashboard 1.0 palette (shout out to them for this amazing work). It is an easy to use collection of nodes for Node-RED that allows you to create data-driven dashboards & data visualisations. With this palette, you can create interactive dashboards that directly running on reCamera with components like buttons charts, text or slider and preview effects.

### Installation

This palette is installed by default in the device. If you want to install it manually, you can follow the steps below:

1. Access to Node-RED Workspace by visiting `ip_address/#/workspace`.
2. Click on the `menu icon` in the upper right corner and select "Manage Palette."
3. Click on the "Install" tab.
4. In the search bar, enter "node-red-contrib-sscma" and click on the "Install" button.
5. Wait for the installation to complete. Please note that because the device limitation, the downloading time will be around 30 seconds to 5 minutes depends on the network speed and the package size.

### Dashboard Nodes

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/dashboard_nodes_docs.png" /></div>

Popular nodes like `button`, `slider`, `switch`, `text` and `templete` are very handy when it comes to building dashboard for reCamera. View [detail docs of each node](https://dashboard.flowfuse.com/nodes/widgets/ui-button.html) on their official website, or watch their [beginner tutorial](https://youtu.be/DFNv91TTt68?si=HjTSh1G8xgCBF0jS) to get a better understanding of nodes and widgets in this palette.

### Example Flow with Dashboard Nodes

With OS version 0.1.4 and above, a default dashboard flow is installed with the device as an unbox example for users to get started. Any OS version lower than 0.1.4 will not have the default dashboard flow.

The functionality of this flow is to preview the model output, provide different demos such as countinng pereson, dog, cat or bottle. It also provides an example of how to inframe basic webpage to the dashboard such as network, terminal, ssh pages and device info such as CPU, memory, disk usage and so on.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/dashboard_example.png" /></div>

In this dashboard, the following nodes are used:

- `slider` node: Used to control the confidence and IoU of the model.
- `dropdown` node: Used to select the Demo.
- `text` node: Used to display models name and some textual information.
- `template` node: Used to render the base64 image code and draw the bounding box on the image.
- `function` node: Used to parse the output of the model node to the template node and add some logic to other nodes.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/dashboard_flow.png" /></div>

The json of this flow is as below:
