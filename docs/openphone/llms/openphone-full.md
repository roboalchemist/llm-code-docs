Learn how to gain API access.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin using the Quo API, ensure you have:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="An active Quo subscription" icon="check">
    Need an account? Follow our [account creation
    guide](https://support.openphone.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500009886621-How-to-create-an-OpenPhone-account).
  </Card>

  <Card title="Admin access" icon="user-shield">
    Owner or admin privileges in your Quo workspace.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  **US Messaging Registration Required:** To send text messages to US numbers
  via the API, you must complete US Carrier Registration. Learn more
  [here](https://support.openphone.com/hc/en-us/articles/15519949741463-Guide-to-US-carrier-registration-for-OpenPhone-customers).
</Warning>

## API key generation

The Quo API uses API keys for secure authentication. Follow these steps to get started:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to Quo">Access your Quo account.</Step>

  <Step title="Access API Settings">
    Navigate to the "API" tab under workspace settings. Remember, you need
    workspace owner or admin privileges to access this tab.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate your key">
    Click "Generate API key" and provide a descriptive label. Each key provides
    full API access.

    <Tip>
      Label your keys based on their intended use (e.g., "Production
      Environment" or "Testing Integration")
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Implement authentication">
    Include your API key in the Authorization header of each request: `    Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY`
    <Tip>The Quo API does not use a Bearer token for authentication.</Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security guidelines

<Info>
  Your API key carries the same privileges as your Quo account. Treat it
  with the same level of security as your password.
</Info>

### Best practices

* Keep your API keys confidential
* Don’t share your API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub or client-side code
* Regularly rotate your API keys to enhance security
* If a key is compromised, revoke it immediately and generate a new one

### Revoking access

If a key is compromised or no longer needed:

1. Navigate to the "API" tab in Workspace Settings
2. Locate the specific key
3. Click the ellipsis (three dots) icon and select 'delete' to immediately revoke access
4. Generate a new key if needed

<Note>
  Deleting an API key only affects the integrations using that specific key.
  Other keys and integrations will continue to function normally.

<Update label="January 22, 2025" description="1.2.0">
  ### Minor Changes

  * Adds a property `externalId` to the contact model. Adds `externalId` and `source` as optional parameters to the Create Contact (`POST /contacts`) request.
  * Adds `externalId` and `source` as optional parameters to the Update Contact (`PATCH /contacts/:id`) request.
  * Added a route to list contacts (`GET /contacts`).

  ### Patch Changes

  * Fixed an issue where creating or updating a contact with an invalid custom field would result in 500 error. Sending an invalid custom field will now result in a 400 "Invalid Custom Field Item" error.
</Update>

<Update label="December 6, 2024" description="1.1.2">
  ### Patch Changes

  * Fixed an issue where paginated endpoints would return a string token for the next page at the end of paginated results. Now, they will correctly return the next page token as `null`.

  * Added a callout that the `totalItems` result field for the paginated endpoints is not functioning as expected and is not returning the true total items count.
</Update>

<Update label="November 25, 2024" description="1.1.1">
  ### Patch Changes

  * Fixes an issue where phone numbers in various routes were expected to be in E164 format, but the format was not being validated correctly.
</Update>

<Update label="November 7, 2024" description="1.1.0">
  ## 1.1.0

  ### Minor Changes

  * Adds a property, `restrictions`, to the objects in the response from list phone numbers (`GET /phone-numbers`). The new property contains information about regional restrictions for outbound calling and messaging from a phone number.
</Update>

<Update label="November 4, 2024" description="1.0.2">
  ### Patch Changes

  * Fixed an issue with list calls (`GET /calls`) where sending an empty participants param resulted in a 500 response. Sending an empty participants param will now result in a descriptive 400 response.
  * Fixes an issue where attempting to send a message to an international number would result in a 500 response if international messaging is not enabled in the workspace. With this fix, the 500 error response changed to a 403 with a descriptive message
  * Fixes a bug where the GET call recordings endpoint sometimes returned an empty array.
  * Fixes an issue that was preventing some call records from returning successfully from `GET /calls`
  * Fixes an issue where getting a contact by id would result in a 500 instead of a 404 when contact is not found. Now this will respond in a 404 with a descriptive message.
  * Fixes an issue where sending a message that contained only whitespace (`' '`, `'\n'`, etc.) resulted in a 500 error response. Now, this will respond with 400 and a validation error message instead.
</Update>

<Update label="October 22, 2024" description="1.0.1">
  ### Patch Changes

  * Fixes an issue with List Calls (`GET /calls`) where the user ID applied by default when the user ID parameter was not sent was being set to the workspace owner instead of the phone number owner.
</Update>

<Update label="October 21, 2024" description="1.0.0">

## Ping!

Let's get started sending text messages via the Quo API.

<Note> **Have you completed Carrier Registration?** If you plan to send text messages to US numbers via the API, you will also need to complete US Carrier Registration. Learn more [here](https://support.openphone.com/hc/en-us/articles/15519949741463-Guide-to-US-carrier-registration-for-OpenPhone-customers).</Note>

### 1. Get phone numbers (optional)

Make a call to the `GET Phone Numbers` endpoint to retrieve `userId` and `from` for the desired number (the phone number from which you'd like to send a text message). This step is optional if you already know the `userId` and `from` for the desired sending number.

```
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.openphone.com/v1/phone-numbers \
  --header 'Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

### 2. Specify user ID (optional)

If you'd like to send the text message as a particular Quo member in your workspace, make sure to include this `userId` in your request body. If `userId` is not specified, the sender will default to the phone number owner.

### 3. Send your message

You are now ready to send your first text message! Once you send your text message, you will receive a 202 Success Message via the API. Nice!

```
 curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.openphone.com/v1/messages \
  --header 'Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "content": "<string>",
  "from": "<string>",
  "to": [
    "+15555555555"
  ],
  "userId": "<string>"
}'
```

<Tip>Be sure to format phone numbers in E.164 format (+1234567890).</Tip>

### Summary

You are now able to send a text message to anyone in US or Canada. By using the API, you are able to programmatically send texts to your customers.

# Building with AI LLMs
Source: https://www.quo.com/docs/mdx/guides/building-with-ai-llms

Learn how to use AI Language Models to build applications with the Quo API.

## Introduction

Building with Large Language Models (LLMs) can significantly accelerate your Quo API integration development. This guide will help you effectively use LLMs to create applications with our API.

<Note>
  While we provide examples using Claude, the principles and practices outlined here apply to any capable LLM platform.
</Note>

## Getting started

### Documentation setup

Before beginning development with an LLM, gather and prepare the necessary documentation:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download OpenAPI specification">
    Get our [OpenAPI specification](https://openphone-public-api-prod.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public/openphone-public-api-v1-prod.json) for detailed endpoint information.

    **Tip**: Right-click and select "Save Link As..." to download the file
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get complete documentation">
    Download and extract our [complete documentation package](https://openphone-public-api-prod.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public/openphone-public-api-llm-ready-docs-prod.zip)

    2. Allows me to select a number to send a message with
    3. Lets me input an external phone number to send a message to
    4. Sends a message to the external phone number

    Please help me implement this using the Quo API.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Contact management example">
    ```text theme={null}
    Help me create a system to:
    1. Sync contacts from my CRM
    2. Update contact details automatically
    3. Track message history per contact
    4. Generate contact activity reports
    ```
  </Accordion>

# External contacts
Source: https://www.quo.com/docs/mdx/guides/contacts

Learn about working with contacts imported via the Quo API or native integrations.

## Understanding external contacts

External contacts are contacts that originate from outside the Quo app: either created through the Quo API or synced via native integrations (such as CRM or other connected platforms). These contacts allow you to centralize contact records from multiple sources within your Quo workspace.

### Key characteristics

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Distinct from app-created contacts">
    External contacts are separate from contacts created directly in the Quo app, with their own specific behaviors depending on how they were created.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Two sources, different behaviors">
    External contacts can come from two sources: the Quo API or native integrations and each has different editability rules within the Quo app.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Editability by source

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="API-created contacts" icon="code">
    Contacts created via the Quo API can be updated directly within the Quo app. You can also continue managing them programmatically through API endpoints.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Native integration contacts" icon="plug">
    Contacts synced from native integrations remain read-only within Quo. Any changes must be made in the source system and synced back to Quo.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Important behaviors and limitations

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Preserving contact IDs">
    When you create a contact using the `POST /contacts` endpoint, it's essential to save the `id` returned in the response. This `id` will be required for all future API operations involving the contact.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Visibility in the Quo app">
    After creating an API contact, it will only appear in the Quo app—whether in the conversation list, contact list, or search results—if there's an associated conversation with a matching phone number.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Contact field structure

Quo organizes contact information using two distinct field types. Understanding these is crucial for effective contact management.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Default fields">
    Every contact in Quo includes these predefined fields:

    * First Name
    * Last Name
    * Role
    * Company
    * Emails
    * Phone Numbers

    These fields maintain consistent properties across all contacts and form the foundation of contact information.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Custom fields">
    Custom fields allow for flexible, user-defined contact properties. Supported data types include:

    * Address
    * Boolean
    * Date
    * Multi-select
    * Number
    * String
    * URL

    <Note>
      **Managing Custom Fields:** Custom field definitions can only be modified within the Quo app. The API does not currently support creating or editing custom field definitions.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Creating and managing contacts via API

Follow these steps to effectively create and manage contacts through the API:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Retrieve custom fields">
    First, call the `GET /contact-custom-fields` endpoint to retrieve your workspace's custom contact field definitions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Prepare contact data">
    Structure your contact data according to both default and custom fields:

    ```json theme={null}
    {
      "defaultFields": {
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Doe",
        "phoneNumbers": [
          {
            "name": "primary",
            "value": "+1234567890"
          }
        ]
      },
      "customFields": {
        // Include any custom field values here
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the contact">
    Use the `POST /contacts` endpoint to create the contact and store the returned contact ID for future operations.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Manage the contact">
    Update contacts either within the Quo app or programmatically using the `PATCH /contacts/:id` endpoint with the saved contact ID.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Always validate phone numbers are in E.164 format (+1234567890) before creating or updating contacts to ensure proper functionality.
</Tip>


# Sync your contacts
Source: https://www.quo.com/docs/mdx/guides/sync-contacts

Implement a one-way contact sync from Google Sheets to Quo using Javascript.

## Overview

This guide provides a foundation for implementing a one-way sync from Google Sheets to Quo using JavaScript. You may need to adjust some details based on your specific requirements and environment. Remember to thoroughly test the implementation to ensure data integrity.

## Development guide

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Setup and authentication">
    ##### 1.1 Quo API.

    * Obtain your Quo API key from the Quo dashboard.

    ##### 1.2 Google Sheets API

    * Enable the Google Sheets API in your Google Cloud Console.
    * Create service account credentials and download the JSON key file.

    ##### 1.3 Google Sheets

    * Create a Google Sheet in the following format:

      | contactId | firstName | lastName | phone          | email                                       |
      | --------- | --------- | -------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
      |           | Jane      | Doe      | (555) 555-5555 | [jane@example.com](mailto:jane@example.com) |

    * Share your Google Sheet with the service account email address.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Environment setup">
    ##### 2.1 Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.

    ##### 2.2 Create a new Node.js project and initialize it

    ```bash theme={null}
    mkdir quo-sync
    cd quo-sync
    npm init -y
    ```

    ##### 2.3 Install required packages

    ```bash theme={null}
    npm install googleapis axios dotenv node-cron
    ```

    ##### 2.4 Create a .env file to store environment variables

    ```bash theme={null}
    QUO_API_KEY=your_quo_api_key
    GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path/to/your/credentials.json
    GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=your_google_sheet_id
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Implement the sync process">
    ##### 3.1 Create a new file named `sync.js` and add the setup functions

    ```js theme={null}
    require("dotenv").config();
    const { google } = require("googleapis");
    const axios = require("axios");
    const cron = require("node-cron");

    const API_BASE_URL = "https://api.openphone.com/v1";

    const quo = axios.create({
      baseURL: API_BASE_URL,
      headers: {
        Authorization: process.env.QUO_API_KEY,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
    });

    const googleAuth = new google.auth.GoogleAuth({
      keyFile: process.env.GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS,
      scopes: ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets"],
    });
    ```

    ##### 3.2 Add the Quo API helper functions

    ```js theme={null}
    async function createQuoContact(contactData) {
      const response = await quo.post("/contacts", contactData);
      return response.data.data;
    }

    async function updateQuoContact(contactId, contactData) {
      const response = await quo.patch(`/contacts/${contactId}`, contactData);
      return response.data.data;
    }
    ```

    ##### 3.3 Add the Google Sheets to Quo contacts mapping function

    ```js theme={null}
    function mapFields(sheetRow) {
      if (!sheetRow.firstName) {
        console.warn("Missing required firstName in row: ", sheetRow);
        return;
      }
      return {
        defaultFields: {
          firstName: sheetRow.firstName,
          lastName: sheetRow.lastName,
          phoneNumbers: sheetRow.phone
            ? [{ name: "primary", value: sheetRow.phone }]
            : undefined,
          emails: sheetRow.email
            ? [{ name: "primary", value: sheetRow.email }]
            : undefined,
        },
      };
    }
    ```

    ##### 3.4 Add the Google Sheets helper functions

    ```js theme={null}
    async function getGoogleSheetsData() {
      const sheets = google.sheets({ version: "v4", googleAuth });

      const response = await sheets.spreadsheets.values.get({
        spreadsheetId: process.env.GOOGLE_SHEET_ID,
        range: "Sheet1!A1:Z", // First sheet and all initial columns
      });

      const rows = response.data.values;
      const headers = rows[0]; // First row contains headers
      return rows.slice(1).map((row) => { // Skip the first row and map the contact data
        const contact = {};
        headers.forEach((header, index) => {
          contact[header] = row[index];
        });
        return contact;
      });
    }

    async function updateSheetWithContactId(rowNumber, contactId) {
      const sheets = google.sheets({ version: "v4", googleAuth });

      await sheets.spreadsheets.values.update({
        spreadsheetId: process.env.GOOGLE_SHEET_ID,
        range: `Sheet1!A${rowNumber + 2}`, // +2 to account for 1-based index and header row
        valueInputOption: "RAW",
        resource: { values: [[contactId]] },
      });
    }
    ```

    ##### 3.4 Finally, tie it all together

    ```js theme={null}
    async function syncContacts() {
      const sheetContacts = await getGoogleSheetsData();

      for (const [rowNumber, sheetRow] of sheetContacts.entries()) {
        const mappedContact = mapFields(sheetRow);
        if (sheetRow.contactId) {
          await updateQuoContact(sheetRow.contactId, mappedContact);
        } else {
          const { id } = await createQuoContact(mappedContact);
          await updateSheetWithContactId(rowNumber, id);
        }
      }

      console.log("Sync completed successfully");
    }

    // Run sync every hour
    cron.schedule("0 * * * *", syncContacts);
    console.log("Sync process started. Running every hour.");
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="4. Running the sync process">
    ```bash theme={null}
    node sync.js
    ```

    This will start the sync process, which will run every hour.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Considerations and Optimizations

* Implement deletion logic to remove contacts from Quo that are no longer present in the Google Sheet.
* Implement pagination for fetching Quo contacts if you have a large number of contacts.
* Implement more robust error handling and retry mechanisms.
* Implement logging for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.
* Consider using a database to store the state of the sync process and to track changes between syncs.
* Consider implementing rate-limiting and an incremental sync to reduce API calls and processing time.
* For production use, consider deploying this script to a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS Lambda for better reliability and scalability.


# Webhooks
Source: https://www.quo.com/docs/mdx/guides/webhooks

A reference for API-generated webhook payloads.

## Overview

Quo API webhooks allow developers to receive real-time notifications for various events, such as calls, messages, and transcripts. By integrating webhooks into your workflows, you can automate processes, enhance user experiences, and seamlessly connect Quo with other systems.

<Note>
  **Important note:** Webhooks created in the Quo app are not compatible with those created via the API. You cannot access or modify app webhooks through the API, or API webhooks in the app.
</Note>

## Webhooks payload sample data models

Each webhook event provides a structured payload with specific data. We've provided sample payloads below for the most common webhook events.

### Calls

We’ve provided the below tips to help you minimize segment counts and save money.

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Watch Your character count" icon="square-1">
    Standard Latin alphabet characters, numbers, and basic punctuation use 160 characters per segment.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Be cautious with special characters" icon="square-2">
    Some special characters (é, ñ, ß) reduce segment capacity to 70 characters.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Minimize emoji usage" icon="square-3">
    Most emojis count as two characters. Extensive use can quickly increase segment count.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Avoid line breaks" icon="square-4">
    Each line break counts as a character.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Use URL shorteners" icon="square-5">
    Long URLs can span multiple segments. Shortened links save space.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Leverage common abbreviations" icon="square-6">

# API Pricing overview
Source: https://www.quo.com/docs/mdx/pricing-support/pricing-overview

Welcome to Quo's simple and transparent API pricing structure.

## Our pricing philosophy

At Quo, we believe in transparent and fair pricing. Sometimes it can be hard to understand the true cost of something when it's buried in the fine print. We are committed to helping you clearly understand and manage your costs when using our platform.

## Core pricing model

Our pricing is based on message segments, making it easy to calculate costs:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Local (US and Canada) SMS" icon="location-pin">
    <p>\$0.01 per segment</p>
  </Card>

  <Card title="International SMS" icon="globe">
    <p>\$0.01 + country-specific rate per segment</p>
    <p>Rates vary by destination country</p>
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  For detailed international rates by country, see our [International Pricing Guide](https://www.openphone.com/rates).
</Info>

## Understanding message segments

A **segment** is the basic unit we use to calculate SMS billing. Every message you send is divided into one or more segments based on two factors:

1. **Message length** (character count)
2. **Character type** (standard or special characters)

## How character types affect segment size

### Standard GSM characters

Messages using only standard GSM-7 characters fit **up to 160 characters per segment**.

Standard characters include:

* Letters (A-Z, a-z)
* Numbers (0-9)
* Spaces
* Basic punctuation (. , ! ? - etc.)

### Special/Non-GSM characters

<Info>
  **If your message contains even one special character, the entire message is billed at the 70-character limit** — not just the portion with special characters. This often results in more segments and higher costs than you might expect.
</Info>

Messages containing **any** special characters fit only **up to 70 characters per segment**.

Special characters include:

* Accented letters (é, ñ, ü)
* Curly/smart quotes (" " ' ')
* Emojis (😊, 🚀, ✨)
* Many international characters

## Tools and optimization

### Segment calculator

Use our [Segment Calculator](https://twiliodeved.github.io/message-segment-calculator/) tool to estimate costs before sending messages. This helps you optimize your message length and content to avoid unexpected charges.

### Smart encoding

The Quo API automatically enables **smart encoding** to minimize segment usage and reduce costs wherever possible. This feature works behind the scenes to choose the most efficient encoding for your messages.

## API message types

You're only charged for outgoing API-powered messages, which include:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Direct API Usage" icon="code">
    Messages sent through direct API calls
  </Card>

  <Card title="Integration Messages" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Messages sent via applications built with our API
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How our billing works

We use a credit-based system for all API messaging charges:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Purchase credits">
    Add funds to your account through the "Plans & Billing" tab
  </Step>

  <Step title="Automatic deduction">
    Credits are automatically deducted when messages are sent
  </Step>

  <Step title="Credit management">
    Monitor your balance and enable auto-recharge to prevent service interruptions
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Important service notes

### Requirements & limitations

1. An active Quo subscription is required for API access.
2. MMS is not supported in the current API version.
3. Partial credits cannot be used for sending messages; the API will return an error.

<Warning>
  If your credit balance is insufficient for a message's full cost, the API will return an error and the message won't be sent.
</Warning>
