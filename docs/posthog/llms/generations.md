# Generations - Docs

Generations are events that capture LLM calls and their responses. They represent interactions and conversations with an AI model. Generations are tracked as `$ai_generation` events and can be used to create and visualize [insights](/docs/product-analytics/insights.md) just like other PostHog events.

View recent AI generation events in the **Activity** tab

The **LLM analytics** > [**Generations** tab](https://app.posthog.com/llm-analytics/generations) displays a list of generations, along with a preview of key autocaptured properties. You can filter and search for generations by various properties.

## What does each generation capture?

A generation event records the AI model’s inputs, generated output, and additional metadata – like token usage, latency, and cost – for each LLM call.

PostHog automatically logs and displays the generation and its data within a conversation view for contextual debugging and analysis. You can also view the raw JSON payload.

You can expect each generation to have the following properties (in addition to the [default event properties](/docs/data/events.md#default-properties)):

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| $ai_model | The specific model, like gpt-5-mini or claude-4-sonnet |
| $ai_latency | The latency of the LLM call in seconds |
| $ai_time_to_first_token | Time to first token in seconds (streaming only) |
| $ai_tools | Tools and functions available to the LLM |
| $ai_input | List of messages sent to the LLM |
| $ai_input_tokens | The number of tokens in the input (often found in response.usage) |
| $ai_output_choices | List of response choices from the LLM |
| $ai_output_tokens | The number of tokens in the output (often found in response.usage) |
| $ai_total_cost_usd | The total cost in USD (input + output) |
| [[...]](/docs/llm-analytics/generations.md#event-properties) | See [full list](/docs/llm-analytics/generations.md#event-properties) of properties |

When calling LLMs with our [SDK wrappers](/docs/llm-analytics/installation.md), you can also enrich the `$ai_generation` event with your own [custom properties](/docs/llm-analytics/custom-properties.md) and PostHog attributes like groups and distinct IDs for identified users.

### Python

```python
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5-mini",
    input=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a fun fact about hedgehogs"}
    ],
    posthog_distinct_id="user_123", # optional
    posthog_trace_id="trace_123", # optional
    posthog_properties={"custom_property": "value"}, # optional
    posthog_groups={"company": "company_id_in_your_db"},  # optional
    posthog_privacy_mode=False # optional
)
```

### TypeScript

```typescript
const completion = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-5-mini",
    input: [{ role: "user", content: "Tell me a fun fact about hedgehogs" }],
    posthogDistinctId: "user_123", // optional
    posthogTraceId: "trace_123", // optional
    posthogProperties: { custom_property: "value" }, // optional
    posthogGroups: { company: "company_id_in_your_db" }, // optional
    posthogPrivacyMode: false // optional
});
```

## How are generations, traces, and spans related?

Generations are nested under [spans](/docs/llm-analytics/spans.md) and [traces](/docs/llm-analytics/traces.md).

A trace is the top-level entity that groups all related LLM operations, including spans and generations, together.

Spans are individual operations within a trace. Some spans represent generations, which are also uniquely identified using the `$ai_span_id` property. However, most spans track other types of LLM operations such as tool calls, RAG retrieval, data processing, and more.

## Tool calls

When a generation includes tool calls (function calls), PostHog automatically extracts them and displays them as tags on the generation. You can see aggregated tool usage across all your generations in the [Tools](/docs/llm-analytics/tools.md) tab.

## Evaluating generations

You can automatically assess the quality of your generations using [evaluations](/docs/llm-analytics/evaluations.md). Evaluations use an LLM-as-a-judge approach to score outputs based on criteria like relevance, helpfulness, or safety.

## Sentiment classification

PostHog can classify the sentiment of user messages in your generations as negative, neutral, or positive. Sentiment is computed on-demand using a local model when you view a [trace](/docs/llm-analytics/traces.md) — no data is sent to third-party services. See [Sentiment classification](/docs/llm-analytics/sentiment.md) for more details.

## Event properties

A generation is a single call to an LLM.

**Event name**: `$ai_generation`

### Core properties
