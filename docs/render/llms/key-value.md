# Render Key Value — Provision Redis®-compatible datastores for caching and job queues.

*Render Key Value* provides low-latency in-memory storage that's ideal for shared caches and job queues. Key Value instances are compatible with virtually all clients that interact with Redis®<sup>\*</sup>.

Paid Key Value instances include [disk-backed persistence](#data-persistence).

## Underlying libraries

- Newly created Render Key Value instances run Valkey 8.

*What is Valkey?*

[Valkey](https://valkey.io/) is an open-source key-value store that began as a fork of Redis version 7.2.4. For most libraries and frameworks that connect to a Redis instance, Valkey is a drop-in replacement.

  Learn more in the [FAQ](valkey-faq).

- Legacy Key Value instances (created before Feburary 12, 2025) run Redis 6.
  - Legacy instances no longer receive version updates, but they will continue to operate as usual.

## Quickstarts

These Render quickstarts include steps for provisioning a Key Value instance:

- [Deploy a Celery background worker](/deploy-celery)
- [Deploy Rails with Sidekiq](/deploy-rails-sidekiq)
- [Rails caching with Redis](rails-caching-redis)
- [Connecting to Render Key Value with ioredis](connecting-to-redis-with-ioredis)

## Create your Key Value instance

1. Go to [dashboard.render.com/new/redis](https://dashboard.render.com/new/redis), or select *New > Key Value* in the Render Dashboard.

   This form appears:

   [image: New Key Value creation form]

2. Provide a helpful *Name* for your instance.
   - You can change this value at any time.
3. Choose a *Region* to run your instance in.
   - Choose the same region as your services that will connect to the instance. This minimizes latency and enables communication over your [private network](private-network).
4. Optionally change the instance's *Maxmemory Policy*.
   - [See details below.](#maxmemory-policy)
5. Scroll down and select an *instance type*. This determines its available RAM and connection limit.

   [image: Selecting a Valkey instance type]

6. Click *Create Key Value*.

You're all set! Your new instance's status updates to *Available* in the Render Dashboard when it's ready to use.

## Connect to your Key Value instance

Every Key Value instance has two different URLs for incoming connections:

- An *internal URL* for connections from your other Render services running in the _same region_
  - Connections using the internal URL are unauthenticated by default. You can optionally [require authentication for internal connections](#requiring-auth-for-internal-connections).
- An *external URL* for connections from _everything else_
  - Before you can use the external URL, you must first [enable external connections](#enabling-external-connections) for your Key Value instance.

[diagram]

*Use the internal URL wherever possible.* It minimizes latency by enabling communication over your [private network](private-network).

Both URLs are available from the *Connect* menu in the top-right corner of your instance's page in the [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com):

[image: Redis connection URLs]

Key Value instances use `redis://` and `rediss://` URL schemes. You can connect to your instance using any Redis-compatible client that supports these schemes.

### Internal connection examples

> To connect with your internal URL, your Key Value instance and your connecting service must belong to the same workspace _and_ run in the same [region](regions).

**ioredis (JS)**

```js
import Redis from 'ioredis'

// Connect to your Key Value instance using the REDIS_URL environment variable
// The REDIS_URL is set to the internal connection URL e.g. redis://red-343245ndffg023:6379
const redis = new Redis(process.env.REDIS_URL)

// Set and retrieve some values
await redis.set('key', 'ioredis')
const result = await redis.get('key')
console.log(result)
```

**node-redis (JS)**

```js
import { createClient } from 'redis'

// Connect to your Key Value instance using the REDIS_URL environment variable
// The REDIS_URL is set to the internal connection URL e.g. redis://red-343245ndffg023:6379
const client = createClient({ url: process.env.REDIS_URL })
await client.connect()

// Set and retrieve some values
await client.set('key', 'node redis')
const value = await client.get('key')
console.log(value)
```

**redis-py (Python)**

```python
import os
import redis

# Connect to your Key Value instance using the REDIS_URL environment variable
# The REDIS_URL is set to the internal connection URL e.g. redis://red-343245ndffg023:6379
r = redis.from_url(os.environ['REDIS_URL'])

# Set and retrieve some values
r.set('key', 'redis-py')
print(r.get('key').decode())
```

**redis-rb (Ruby)**

```ruby
require "redis"

# Connect to your internal Key Value instance using the REDIS_URL environment variable
# The REDIS_URL is set to the internal connection URL e.g. redis://red-343245ndffg023:6379
redis = Redis.new(url: ENV["REDIS_URL"])

# Set and retrieve some values
redis.set("key", "redis ruby!")
puts redis.get("key")
```

**Sidekiq (Ruby)**

```ruby
require "sidekiq"

# Connect to your internal Key Value instance using the REDIS_URL environment variable
# The REDIS_URL is set to the internal connection URL e.g. redis://red-343245ndffg023:6379
Sidekiq.configure_server do |config|
  config.redis = { url: ENV["REDIS_URL"] }
end

Sidekiq.configure_client do |config|
  config.redis = { url: ENV["REDIS_URL"] }
end

# Simple example from https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Getting-Started
class HardJob
  include Sidekiq::Job

  def perform(name, count)
    # do something
  end
end

HardJob.perform_async("bob", 5)
```

### Enabling external connections

By default, newly created Key Value instances are _not_ reachable at their external URL. To keep your instance secure, you can grant external access to specific sets of IPs.

In the [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com), go to your Key Value instance's *Info* page and scroll down to the *Networking* section:

[image: Setting Key Value access control in the Render Dashboard]

Here you can specify IP address blocks using [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_blocks). The example above grants access to two example blocks: one for an office network and another for a single development machine.

> *These rules apply only to connections that use your Key Value instance's external URL.*
>
> Your Render services in the same region as your Key Value instance can always connect using your instance's [internal URL](#connect-to-your-key-value-instance).

If you attempt to connect from a disallowed IP address, your client will display an error like the following:

```
AUTH failed: Client IP address is not in the allowlist.
```

### Requiring auth for internal connections

By default, Key Value instances do not require authentication for internal connections over your [private network](private-network). This is why the default internal connection URL doesn't include a username or password:

```sh
# An unauthenticated internal URL (default)
redis://red-abc123:6379

# An authenticated internal URL
redis://USERNAME_HERE:PASSWORD_HERE@red-abc123:6379
```

> [External connections](#enabling-external-connections) always require authentication.

To enforce additional security or fulfill compliance requirements, your Key Value instance can require authentication for internal connections:

1. From your Key Value instance's *Info* page in the [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com), scroll down to the *Connections* section and click *Enable Internal Authentication*:

> *Any existing connections that use your unauthenticated URL will break!*
>
>    Before enabling this feature, we strongly recommend migrating your existing connections to use an authenticated URL. [See below.](#migrating-unauthenticated-key-value-connections)

   [image: Enabling Key Value internal auth in the Render Dashboard]

2. A confirmation dialog appears. Review the advisories, then click *Enable Internal Authentication*.

After you confirm, Render restarts your Key Value instance (it will be unavailable for a few seconds).

After the restart:

- Your Key Value instance now requires authentication for all connections.
- In the Render Dashboard, your instance's internal connection URL now includes a username and password.

#### Migrating unauthenticated Key Value connections

Before you [require authentication](#requiring-auth-for-internal-connections) for internal Key Value connections, you can update all of your existing connections to use an authenticated URL. This will prevent those connections from breaking when you enable authentication.

1. Obtain your Key Value instance's _external_ connection URL from the *Connect* menu:

   [image: Obtaining your Key Value instance's external connection URL]

> *External URL isn't shown?*
>
>    You first need to add at least one IP range to your instance's [access control list](#enabling-external-connections). To continue blocking all external connections, you can add the dummy IP range `0.0.0.0/32`.

2. Extract the password from your external connection URL. The password starts just after the colon (`:`) and ends just before the "at" symbol (`@`):

   ```
   rediss://user:PASSWORD_HERE@red-abc123:6379
   ```

3. For each service that connects to your Key Value instance with the internal URL, modify its connection string as shown below:

   ```sh
   # Before
   redis://red-abc123:6379

   # After
   redis://default:PASSWORD_HERE@red-abc123:6379
   ```

   Specifically, you add the username `default` and the password you extracted in the previous step. Every Key Value instance has a user named `default`, and this user can accept _any_ password until auth is required.

4. Redeploy your modified services (unless they automatically redeployed when you updated their configuration).

5. You can now proceed through the steps to [require authentication](#requiring-auth-for-internal-connections) for internal connections.

After your Key Value instance restarts with authentication enabled, the `default` user now _requires_ the exact password you provided. Because you've updated your connections accordingly, they remain functional.

### Connecting with CLI tools

The [`redis-cli`](https://redis.io/topics/rediscli) is a useful administrative tool for exploring and manipulating data on your Redis instance. There are 2 ways you can use `redis-cli` with your Redis instance:

- If you have a running non-Docker service, `redis-cli` will be available as part of the environment and is accessible from the service's Shell page. The service must be in the same region as the Redis instance. You can also [SSH into that service](ssh) and run `redis-cli` from there.

- You can run `redis-cli` locally on your machine. You first need to [install](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/) `redis-cli` onto your machine. A copy and pastable `redis-cli` command is available in the `External Access` section of your Redis settings. Note that you first need to [enable external connections](#enabling-external-connections) for your Redis instance.

> External connections are TLS secured. The Redis CLI command provided will include the `--tls` flag.

After you connect, you can set and get keys using various commands:

```
oregon-redis.render.com:6379> set "render_is_cool" true
OK
oregon-redis.render.com:6379> get "render_is_cool"
"true"
oregon-redis.render.com:6379> KEYS r*
1) "render_is_cool"
```

## Configure your Key Value instance

### Maxmemory policy

Your Key Value instance's *maxmemory policy* determines which data it evicts to free space when it reaches its memory limit. You select a policy on instance creation and can change it later.

- *For caching use cases,* we recommend using `allkeys-lru`.
- *For job queues,* we recommend using `noeviction` to ensure that queued jobs are not lost.
- *For other use cases,* select a policy from the table below based on your requirements.

You can select any of the following policies:

| Option | Description | Can memory fill up? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `allkeys-lru` | Evict any key using approximated Least Recently Used (LRU). | No |
| `noeviction` | Don't evict data. Instead, return an error on write operations whenever the instance is out of memory. | Yes |
| `volatile-lru` | Evict using approximated LRU, only keys with an expire set. | Yes |
| `volatile-lfu` | Evict using approximated Least Frequently Used (LFU), only keys with an expire set. | Yes |
| `allkeys-lfu` | Evict any key using approximated LFU. | No |
| `volatile-random` | Remove a random key having an expire set. | Yes |
| `allkeys-random` | Remove a random key, any key. | No |
| `volatile-ttl` | Remove the key with the nearest expire time (minor TTL) | Yes |

### Changing instance types

You can upgrade your Key Value instance to a larger instance type with more RAM and a higher connection limit.

> *Note the following before you upgrade:*
>
> - It is not currently possible to downgrade a Key Value instance.
> - Your Key Value instance will be unavailable for a minute or two during the upgrade.
> - If you upgrade a Free Key Value instance, all of its data will be lost.
>   - This is because Free Key Value instances don't persist data to disk.

1. In the [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com), open your instance's *Info* page and scroll down to the *Key Value Instance* section.

2. Under *Instance Type*, click *Update*.

3. Select a new instance type and click *Save Changes*.

> *Need an instance with more than 10 GB of RAM?*
>
> Please reach out to our support team in the [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com).

### Blueprint configuration

As with your other services, you can manage your Key Value instances with [Blueprints](infrastructure-as-code), Render's infrastructure-as-code model. For details and examples, see the [Blueprint YAML Reference](blueprint-spec#render-key-value).

## Data persistence

Paid Key Value instances on Render write their state to disk once per second via the configuration `appendfsync everysec`. If a paid instance experiences an interruption (or if you [upgrade your instance type](#changing-instance-types)), you might lose up to one second of writes.

[Free Key Value instances](free#free-key-value) do _not_ persist data to disk.

## Metrics

Metrics for memory usage, CPU load, and active connections are available from your Key Value instance's Metrics page in the Render Dashboard:

[image: Key Value active connections metric]
