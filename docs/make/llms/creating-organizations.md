# Creating organizations

The Make White Label administration interface lets you create organizations from the **Organizations** page. Once created, you need to assign users to the organization by inviting them from the **Organization detail** page. The following procedure requires an instance admin system role, such as `SA` or `Admin`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
By default, unless otherwise specified, new organizations inherit the license parameters of your White Label instance. For example, if your Make White Label license has 8,000,000 operations, then a new organization's license also has an operations limit of 8,000,000. You can define an organization's license by using the API endpoint `/admin/organizations`.
{% endhint %}

1. Go to **Administration > Organizations**.
2. Click **Create a new organization**.
3. **Organization name** defines the name that appears in the UI. Your end user sees this name on their dashboard. You see this name, for example, in the list of organizations when you go to **Administration > Organizations**. **Timezone** defines the time used when executing scenarios and modules. Each user's localization defines how Make displays time, for example, in execution logs. Country represents the organization owner. Select a country based on your end customer's geographic location. You cannot change this after you create the organization.

{% hint style="success" %}
Select the **Timezone** and **Country** based on your customer's needs. Using a `countryID` and `timezoneID` appropriate for your customer ensures that their scheduled scenarios run at the correct time.
{% endhint %}

4. Click **Add** to create the organization.

The new organization appears on the list of organizations on **Administration > Organizations**.
