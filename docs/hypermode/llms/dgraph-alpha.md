# Dgraph Alpha

<Info>
  We're overhauling Dgraph's docs to make them clearer and more approachable. If
  you notice any issues during this transition or have suggestions, please
  [let us know](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/docs/issues).
</Info>

Dgraph Alpha provides several HTTP endpoints for administrators, as follows:

* `/health?all` returns information about the health of all the servers in the
  cluster.
* `/admin/shutdown` initiates a proper
  [shutdown](./overview#shutting-down-database) of the Alpha.

By default the Alpha listens on `localhost` for admin actions (the loopback
address only accessible from the same machine). The `--bindall=true` option
binds to `0.0.0.0` and thus allows external connections.

<Tip>
  Set max file descriptors to a high value like 10000 if you are going to load a
  lot of data.
</Tip>

## Querying Health

You can query the `/admin` graphql endpoint with a query like the one below to
get a JSON consisting of basic information about health of all the servers in
the cluster.

```graphql
query {
  health {
    instance
    address
    version
    status
    lastEcho
    group
    uptime
    ongoing
    indexing
  }
}
```

Here’s an example of JSON returned from the above query:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "health": [
      {
        "instance": "zero",
        "address": "localhost:5080",
        "version": "v2.0.0-rc1",
        "status": "healthy",
        "lastEcho": 1582827418,
        "group": "0",
        "uptime": 1504
      },
      {
        "instance": "alpha",
        "address": "localhost:7080",
        "version": "v2.0.0-rc1",
        "status": "healthy",
        "lastEcho": 1582827418,
        "group": "1",
        "uptime": 1505,
        "ongoing": ["opIndexing"],
        "indexing": ["name", "age"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

* `instance`: Name of the instance. Either `alpha` or `zero`.
* `status`: Health status of the instance. Either `healthy` or `unhealthy`.
* `version`: Version of Dgraph running the Alpha or Zero server.
* `uptime`: Time in nanoseconds since the Alpha or Zero server is up and
  running.
* `address`: IP\_ADDRESS:PORT of the instance.
* `group`: Group assigned based on the replication factor. Read more
  [here](./cluster-setup).
* `lastEcho`: Last time, in Unix epoch, when the instance was contacted by
  another Alpha or Zero server.
* `ongoing`: List of ongoing operations in the background.
* `indexing`: List of predicates for which indexes are built in the background.
  Read more [here](/dgraph/dql/schema#indexes-in-background).

The same information (except `ongoing` and `indexing`) is available from the
`/health` and `/health?all` endpoints of Alpha server.
