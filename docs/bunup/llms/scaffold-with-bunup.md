# Scaffold with Bunup

Spin up a modern, ready-to-publish TypeScript or React component library (or a basic starter) in ~10 seconds.

* 🚀 **Instant Setup**: Scaffold, code, edit README, and publish with a single command - with nothing to rename or configure
* 📦 **Modern**: ESM by default, TypeScript declarations, and optional monorepo support
* 🛠️ **DX First**: Integrated Bun-powered testing, Biome linting and formatting that just works out of the box
* 🚢 **Publishing**: One-command releases with automatic semantic versioning, GitHub tags, and detailed release notes
* ⚡️ **Mind-Blowing Speed**: Build times so fast they feel instantaneous - a library building experience you've never experienced before
* ✨ **Best Practices**: Follows industry standards and modern development conventions out of the box

## Getting Started

You can create a new project by using:

```sh
bunx @bunup/cli@latest create
```

You will be greeted with a few simple questions and that's it! You can now start coding.

You'll choose between two variants:

* **Minimal**: Minimal setup, perfect for building your own setup
* **Full**: Complete modern library setup, just focus on code and publish

If you selected `minimal`, you can skip the next sections which is for those who selected `full` to learn more about the commands and how to release your package. If you selected `minimal`, you set up these things yourself.

## Setup for Releases

NPM now requires [trusted publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers) for automated CI releases, tokens are no longer supported. Your scaffolded project is pre-configured, but needs a one-time setup. After that, simply run `bun run release` for all future releases.

### Setup Steps

1. **Initial Publish:**
   * **Monorepo:** Navigate to your first package (`cd packages/my-first-package`) and run `bun publish --access public`. Repeat for each new package.
   * **Single Package:** Run `bun publish --access public` from the root directory.

2. **Configure Trusted Publishing:**

   * Go to your package's NPM page → Settings tab
   * Select "GitHub Actions" as your publisher

   * Fill in the required fields:
     * **Organization or User:** Your GitHub username or organization name
     * **Repository:** Your repository name
     * **Workflow filename:** Just the filename (e.g., `release.yml`, not the full path)
       * For scaffolded projects using Bunup, use `release.yml` (since it's located at `.github/workflows/release.yml`)

   * Click "Set up connection"

3. **You're Done!**
   * Ensure your repository exists on GitHub and matches the details provided
   * Run `bun run release` to publish

## Development Workflow

After completing the setup, here's how to use your project:

```sh
bun run dev        # Start development mode
bun run test       # Run test suite
bun run lint       # Check code style and find problems
bun run lint:fix   # Fix linting and formatting issues automatically
bun run type-check # Type check TypeScript code
bun run build      # Build production bundle
```

### Development Mode

The `bun run dev` command behaves differently based on your project type:

**React Library**: Launches a Bun + React preview app at `http://localhost:3000` where you can see your components in action.

**TypeScript Library**: Starts watch mode that automatically rebuilds your library whenever you make changes.

## CI/CD Workflows

The project comes with three GitHub Actions workflows:

1. **CI**: Runs on pull requests and pushes to main, validating types, linting, and tests
2. **Release**: Triggered by tags, builds and publishes the package to npm with provenance
3. **Issue Management**: Automatically marks issues as stale after 30 days of inactivity

## Releasing Your Package

When you're ready to release your package, simply run:

```sh
bun run release
```

This will:

1. Prompt you for a new version (patch, minor, or major)
2. Update package.json version
3. Create a Git tag
4. Push changes and tag to GitHub

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:

1. Build the package
2. Generate a GitHub release with changelog
3. Publish to npm with provenance

Happy coding!
