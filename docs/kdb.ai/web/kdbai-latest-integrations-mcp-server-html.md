Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server
===================================

_This page explains how to connect natural language clients to KDB.AI using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and introduces the KDB.AI MCP Server._

Overview
--------

The MCP Server integration allows KDB.AI to work with any client that supports [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro). Applications like Claude, GPT, or Gemini can send natural language requests from either users or AI models, and interact directly with KDB.AI.

KDB.AI can return structured, context-aware responses using its intelligent prompts, curated tools, and production-grade resources—all exposed through the MCP Server.

Designed for compatibility with the growing MCP ecosystem, the integration follows the MCP standard defined by Anthropic. Its modular design supports product-specific APIs and custom logic, making it easy for technical teams to extend functionality.

The **KDB.AI MCP Server** is built on a flexible framework with:

*   **Curated prompts and tools for queries**, table exploration, and LLM guidance
*   **Configurable templates** for adapting behavior to different products or use cases
*   **Built-in protections** that block destructive operations
*   **Auto-discovery** of tools, prompts, and resources—no manual setup required

How it works
------------

The end user enters a natural language request through an **MCP client application**. The LLM embedded in or connected to the client interprets the request and selects the appropriate **tools, prompts, or resources** exposed by the MCP Server.

The client then sends the selected operation to the MCP Server, which routes the request to KDB.AI and returns a structured result. This interaction pattern supports common use cases like enterprise AI assistants, database explorers, and conversational data tools.

Get started
-----------

Configuration and usage instructions are available in the [MCP Server README file](https://github.com/KxSystems/kdbai-mcp-server).
