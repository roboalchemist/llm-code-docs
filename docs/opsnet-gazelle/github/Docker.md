# Docker Notes

Notes on upgrading Docker containers.

## sphinxsearch

No particular notes, the plan is to remove this entirely at some point.

## mysql

This is a little tricky because you want to dump the database from the current
container, upgrade the container, and then restore the database. Something
like the following will work:

```bash
# dump the db
MYSQL_CONTAINER=gaz_mysql_1
PASSWORD=$(grep MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD docker-compose.yml|cut -d= -f2)
docker exec $MYSQL_CONTAINER sh -c "exec mysqldump --all-databases -uroot -p'$PASSWORD'" > all-databases.sql

# do the upgrade
docker compose up -d

# restore the dump
docker exec -i $MYSQL_CONTAINER sh -c "exec mysql -uroot -p'$PASSWORD'" < all-databases.sql

# run the mysql upgrade when moving across major versions
docker exec -it $MYSQL_CONTAINER mysql_upgrade -u root -p$PASSWORD
```

Some custom functions may need to be recreated (the site will error on load):

```bash
git grep -l 'CREATE FUNCTION' misc/my-migrations
```

Files to check:

* `misc/my-migrations/20180104060449_tables.php`
* `misc/my-migrations/20200320183228_bonus_accrual_function.php`

Execute the function definition statements in the mysql client.

## memcache

Just upgrade to the latest image (see Dockerhub).
