            When used with `n`, `best_of` controls the number of candidate

            greater than `n`.

            Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID
            in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100.
            You can use this [tokenizer
            tool](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer?view=bpe) to convert
            text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits
            generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary
            per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase
            likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a
            ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.


            As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the
            <|endoftext|> token from being generated.

            the API will return a list of the 5 most likely tokens. The API will
            always return the `logprob` of the sampled token, so there may be up
            to `logprobs+1` elements in the response.


            The maximum value for `logprobs` is 5.

            The token count of your prompt plus `max_tokens` cannot exceed the

            An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus
            sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with
            top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the
