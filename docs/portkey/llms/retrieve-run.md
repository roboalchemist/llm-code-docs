        `none` means the model will not call any tools and instead generates a
        message.

        `auto` is the default value and means the model can pick between
        generating a message or calling one or more tools.

        `required` means the model must call one or more tools before responding
        to the user.

        Specifying a particular tool like `{"type": "file_search"}` or `{"type":
        "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to
        call that tool.

        Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which
        guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.


        **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the
        model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without
        this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the
        generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and
        seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be
        partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the
        generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max
        context length.
