# Customize Models

We basically categorize model components into 5 types.

- 

backbone: usually an FCN network to extract feature maps, e.g., ResNet, MobileNet.

- 

neck: the component between backbones and heads, e.g., FPN, PAFPN.

- 

head: the component for specific tasks, e.g., bbox prediction and mask prediction.

- 

roi extractor: the part for extracting RoI features from feature maps, e.g., RoI Align.

- 

loss: the component in head for calculating losses, e.g., FocalLoss, L1Loss, and GHMLoss.

## Develop new components

### Add a new backbone

Here we show how to develop new components with an example of MobileNet.

#### 1. Define a new backbone (e.g. MobileNet)

Create a new file `mmdet/models/backbones/mobilenet.py`.

```
import torch.nn as nn

from mmdet.registry import MODELS

@MODELS.register_module()
class MobileNet(nn.Module):

    def __init__(self, arg1, arg2):
        pass

    def forward(self, x):  # should return a tuple
        pass

```
