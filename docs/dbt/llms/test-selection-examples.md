# Test selection examples

Test selection works a little differently from other resource selection. This makes it very easy to:

* run tests on a particular model
* run tests on all models in a subdirectory
* run tests on all models upstream / downstream of a model, etc.

Like all resource types, tests can be selected **directly**, by methods and operators that capture one of their attributes: their name, properties, tags, etc.

Unlike other resource types, tests can also be selected *indirectly* through relationships in your DAG. If a selection method or operator includes a model that a test depends on, dbt will also select that test. For example, when you run `dbt test --select model_b`, dbt includes tests defined on `model_b` as well as tests on related models (like `model_a`) that reference `model_b`.[See the next section](#indirect-selection) for more details on controlling this behavior.

Test selection is powerful, and we know it can be tricky. To that end, we've included lots of examples below:

### Direct selection[​](#direct-selection "Direct link to Direct selection")

Run generic tests only:

```bash
  dbt test --select "test_type:generic"
```

Run singular tests only:

```bash
  dbt test --select "test_type:singular"
```

In both cases, `test_type` checks a property of the test itself. These are forms of "direct" test selection.

### Indirect selection[​](#indirect-selection "Direct link to Indirect selection")

Indirect selection modes control which tests run based on the models you select and their relationships in your DAG. These modes determine how dbt handles tests that reference your selected models, either directly or through upstream/downstream relationships.

You can use the following modes (with `eager` as the default). Test exclusion is always greedy: if ANY parent is explicitly excluded, the test will be excluded as well.

Building subsets of a DAG

The `buildable` and `cautious` modes can be useful when you're only building a subset of your DAG, and you want to avoid test failures in `eager` mode caused by unbuilt resources. You can also achieve this with [deferral](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/defer.md).

#### Eager mode (default)[​](#eager-mode "Direct link to Eager mode (default)")

Most inclusive and runs tests if *any* of the parent nodes are selected, regardless of whether all dependencies are met. This includes *any* tests that reference the selected nodes, even if they also reference other unselected nodes.

For example, if you run `dbt test --select model_b`, eager mode will run:

* Tests directly on `model_b`
* Tests in upstream models (like `model_a`) that reference `model_b`
* Tests in downstream models that reference `model_b`

dbt builds models that depend on the selected model. In this mode, any tests depending on unbuilt resources will raise an error.

#### Buildable mode[​](#buildable-mode "Direct link to Buildable mode")

Buildable mode is a middle ground between `cautious` and `eager`, running only tests that reference selected nodes (or their ancestors). This mode is slightly more inclusive than `cautious` by including tests whose references are each within the selected nodes (or their ancestors). This mode is useful when a test depends on a model *and* a direct ancestor of that model, like confirming an aggregation has the same totals as its input.

#### Cautious mode[​](#cautious-mode "Direct link to Cautious mode")

Cautious is the most exclusive mode and ensures that tests are executed and models are built only when all necessary dependencies of the selected models are met. Restricts tests to only those that exclusively reference selected nodes. Tests will only be executed if all the nodes they depend on are selected, which prevents tests from running if one or more of its parent nodes are unselected and, consequently, unbuilt.

#### Empty mode[​](#empty-mode "Direct link to Empty mode")

Empty mode runs no tests and restricts the build to the selected node, ignoring all indirect dependencies. It doesn't execute any tests, whether they are directly attached to the selected node or not. The empty mode is automatically used for [interactive compilation](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/compile.md#interactive-compile).

### Indirect selection examples[​](#indirect-selection-examples "Direct link to Indirect selection examples")

To visualize these methods, suppose you have `model_a`, `model_b`, and `model_c` and associated data tests. The following illustrates which tests will be run when you execute `dbt build` with the various indirect selection modes:

[![dbt build](/img/docs/reference/indirect-selection-dbt-build.png?v=2 "dbt build")](#)dbt build

[![Eager (default)](/img/docs/reference/indirect-selection-eager.png?v=2 "Eager (default)")](#)Eager (default)

[![Buildable](/img/docs/reference/indirect-selection-buildable.png?v=2 "Buildable")](#)Buildable

[![Cautious](/img/docs/reference/indirect-selection-cautious.png?v=2 "Cautious")](#)Cautious

[![Empty](/img/docs/reference/indirect-selection-empty.png?v=2 "Empty")](#)Empty

* Eager mode (default)
* Buildable mode
* Cautious mode
* Empty mode

In this example, during the build process, any test that depends on the selected "orders" model or its dependent models will be executed, even if it depends other models as well.

```shell
dbt test --select "orders"
dbt build --select "orders"
```

In this example, dbt executes tests that reference "orders" within the selected nodes (or their ancestors).

```shell
dbt test --select "orders" --indirect-selection=buildable
dbt build --select "orders" --indirect-selection=buildable
```

In this example, only tests that depend *exclusively* on the "orders" model will be executed:

```shell
dbt test --select "orders" --indirect-selection=cautious
dbt build --select "orders" --indirect-selection=cautious
```

This mode does not execute any tests, whether they are directly attached to the selected node or not.

```shell

dbt test --select "orders" --indirect-selection=empty
dbt build --select "orders" --indirect-selection=empty
```

### Test selection syntax examples[​](#test-selection-syntax-examples "Direct link to Test selection syntax examples")

Setting `indirect_selection` can also be specified in a [yaml selector](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/yaml-selectors.md#indirect-selection).

The following examples use *eager* mode by default for indirect selection, unless you specify another mode (like `--indirect-selection=cautious`).

The selection operators (`+`, `tags`, and so on) determine which models are selected; the indirect selection mode determines which tests run for those models.

```bash
# Run tests on a model (indirect selection) 
dbt test --select "customers"

# Run tests on two or more specific models (indirect selection)
dbt test --select "customers orders"

# Run tests on all models in the models/staging/jaffle_shop directory (indirect selection)
dbt test --select "staging.jaffle_shop"

# Run tests downstream of a model (note this will select those tests directly!)
dbt test --select "stg_customers+"

# Run tests upstream of a model (indirect selection)
dbt test --select "+stg_customers"

# Run tests on all models with a particular tag (direct + indirect)
dbt test --select "tag:my_model_tag"

# Run tests on all models with a particular materialization (indirect selection)
dbt test --select "config.materialized:table"

# To change the indirect selection mode, add the flag:
dbt test --select "customers" --indirect-selection=cautious
```

The same principle can be extended to tests defined on other resource types. In these cases, we will execute all tests defined on certain sources via the `source:` selection method:

```bash
# tests on all sources

dbt test --select "source:*"

# tests on one source
dbt test --select "source:jaffle_shop"

# tests on two or more specific sources
 dbt test --select "source:jaffle_shop source:raffle_bakery"

# tests on one source table
dbt test --select "source:jaffle_shop.customers"

# tests on everything _except_ sources
dbt test --exclude "source:*"
```

### More complex selection[​](#more-complex-selection "Direct link to More complex selection")

Through the combination of direct and indirect selection, there are many ways to accomplish the same outcome. Let's say we have a data test named `assert_total_payment_amount_is_positive` that depends on a model named `payments`. All of the following would manage to select and execute that test specifically:

```bash

dbt test --select "assert_total_payment_amount_is_positive" # directly select the test by name
dbt test --select "payments,test_type:singular" # indirect selection, v1.2
```

As long as you can select a common property of a group of resources, indirect selection allows you to execute all the tests on those resources, too. In the example above, we saw it was possible to test all table-materialized models. This principle can be extended to other resource types, too:

```bash
# Run tests on all models with a particular materialization
dbt test --select "config.materialized:table"

# Run tests on all seeds, which use the 'seed' materialization
dbt test --select "config.materialized:seed"

# Run tests on all snapshots, which use the 'snapshot' materialization
dbt test --select "config.materialized:snapshot"
```

Note that this functionality may change in future versions of dbt.

### Run tests on tagged columns[​](#run-tests-on-tagged-columns "Direct link to Run tests on tagged columns")

Because the column `order_id` is tagged `my_column_tag`, the test itself also receives the tag `my_column_tag`. Because of that, this is an example of direct selection.

models/\<filename>.yml

```yml

models:
  - name: orders
    columns:
      - name: order_id
        config:
          tags: [my_column_tag] # changed to config in v1.10 and backported to 1.9
        data_tests:
          - unique
```

```bash
dbt test --select "tag:my_column_tag"
```

Currently, tests "inherit" tags applied to columns, sources, and source tables. They do *not* inherit tags applied to models, seeds, or snapshots. In all likelihood, those tests would still be selected indirectly, because the tag selects its parent. This is a subtle distinction, and it may change in future versions of dbt.

### Run tagged tests only[​](#run-tagged-tests-only "Direct link to Run tagged tests only")

This is an even clearer example of direct selection: the test itself is tagged `my_test_tag`, and selected accordingly.

models/\<filename>.yml

```yml

models:
  - name: orders
    columns:
      - name: order_id
        data_tests:
          - unique:
            config:
              tags: [my_test_tag] # changed to config in v1.10
```

```bash
dbt test --select "tag:my_test_tag"
```
