# How do I run models downstream of a seed?

You can run models downstream of a seed using the [model selection syntax](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/syntax.md), and treating the seed like a model.

For example, the following would run all models downstream of a seed named `country_codes`:

```shell
$ dbt run --select country_codes+
```
