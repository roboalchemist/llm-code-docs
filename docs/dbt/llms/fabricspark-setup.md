# Connect Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse to dbt Core

`profiles.yml` file is for dbt Core and dbt fusion only

If you're using dbt platform, you don't need to create a `profiles.yml` file. This file is only necessary when you use dbt Core or dbt Fusion locally. To learn more about Fusion prerequisites, refer to [Supported features](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/fusion/supported-features.md). To connect your data platform to dbt, refer to [About data platforms](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/about-connections.md).

Below is a guide for use with [Fabric Data Engineering](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/data-engineering-overview), a new product within Microsoft Fabric. This adapter currently supports connecting to a lakehouse endpoint.

To learn how to set up dbt using Fabric Warehouse, refer to [Microsoft Fabric Data Warehouse](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/local/connect-data-platform/fabric-setup.md).

## Installing <!-- -->dbt-fabricspark

Use `pip` to install the adapter. Before 1.8, installing the adapter would automatically install `dbt-core` and any additional dependencies. Beginning in 1.8, installing an adapter does not automatically install `dbt-core`. This is because adapters and dbt Core versions have been decoupled from each other so we no longer want to overwrite existing dbt-core installations. Use the following command for installation:

`python -m pip install dbt-core dbt-fabricspark`

## Configuring <!-- -->dbt-fabricspark<!-- -->

For <!-- -->Microsoft Fabric<!-- -->-specific configuration, please refer to [Microsoft Fabric<!-- --> configs.](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/fabricspark-configs.md)

For further info, refer to the GitHub repository: [microsoft/dbt-fabricspark](https://github.com/microsoft/dbt-fabricspark)

## Authentication[​](#authentication "Direct link to Authentication")

The Fabric Lakehouse adapter (`dbt-fabricspark`) connects to Fabric Spark through the Livy API. You can authenticate using Azure CLI, which allows dbt to use credentials from an active `az login` session. To use this method, set `authentication: CLI` in your `profiles.yml` file and run `az login`.

When you authenticate, Azure CLI may open a browser window or prompt you to complete sign-in on the [Microsoft device login](https://microsoft.com/devicelogin) page and enter a one-time code to complete sign-in. Once authentication is successful, dbt automatically reuses the active Azure CLI session for subsequent commands.

Refer to [`session-jobs`](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/local/connect-data-platform/fabricspark-setup.md#session-jobs) for an example authentication configuration.

## Connection methods[​](#connection-methods "Direct link to Connection methods")

`dbt-fabricspark` can connect to Fabric Spark runtime using Fabric Livy API method. The Fabric Livy API allows submitting jobs in two different modes:

* [`session-jobs`](#session-jobs) A Livy session job entails establishing a Spark session that remains active throughout the Spark session. A Spark session, can run multiple jobs (each job is an action), sharing state and cached data between jobs.
* batch jobs entails submitting a Spark application for a single job execution. In contrast to a Livy session job, a batch job doesn't sustain an ongoing Spark session. With Livy batch jobs, each job initiates a new Spark session that ends when the job finishes.

Supported mode

To share the session state among jobs and reduce the overhead of session management, `dbt-fabricspark` adapter supports only `session-jobs` mode.

### session-jobs[​](#session-jobs "Direct link to session-jobs")

`session-jobs` is the preferred method when connecting to Fabric Lakehouse.

\~/.dbt/profiles.yml

```yaml
your_profile_name:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: fabricspark
      method: livy
      authentication: CLI
      endpoint: https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1
      workspaceid: [Fabric Workspace GUID]
      lakehouseid: [Lakehouse GUID]
      lakehouse: [Lakehouse Name]
      schema: [Lakehouse Name]
      spark_config:
        name: [Application Name]
        # optional
        archives:
          - "example-archive.zip"
        conf:
            spark.executor.memory: "2g"
            spark.executor.cores: "2"

          numExecutors: 3

      connect_timeout: 10
      retry_all: true
```

## Optional configurations[​](#optional-configurations "Direct link to Optional configurations")

### Retries[​](#retries "Direct link to Retries")

Intermittent errors can crop up unexpectedly while running queries against Fabric Spark. If `retry_all` is enabled, `dbt-fabricspark` will naively retry any queries that fails, based on the configuration supplied by `connect_timeout` and `connect_retries`. It does not attempt to determine if the query failure was transient or likely to succeed on retry. This configuration is recommended in production environments, where queries ought to be succeeding. The default `connect_retries` configuration is 2.

For instance, this will instruct dbt to retry all failed queries up to 3 times, with a 5 second delay between each retry:

\~/.dbt/profiles.yml

```yaml
retry_all: true
connect_timeout: 5
connect_retries: 3
```

### Spark configuration[​](#spark-configuration "Direct link to Spark configuration")

Spark can be customized using [Application Properties](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html). Using these properties the execution can be customized, for example, to allocate more memory to the driver process. Also, the Spark SQL runtime can be set through these properties. For example, this allows the user to [set a Spark catalogs](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html#spark-sql).

### Supported functionality[​](#supported-functionality "Direct link to Supported functionality")

Most dbt Core functionality is supported, Please refer to [Delta Lake interoporability](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/fundamentals/delta-lake-interoperability).

Delta-only features:

1. Incremental model updates by `unique_key` instead of `partition_by` (see [`merge` strategy](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/spark-configs.md#the-merge-strategy))
2. [Snapshots](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/snapshots.md)
3. [Persisting](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/persist_docs.md) column-level descriptions as database comments

### Limitations[​](#limitations "Direct link to Limitations")

1. Lakehouse schemas are not supported. Refer to [limitations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/lakehouse-schemas#public-preview-limitations)
2. Service principal authentication is not supported yet by Livy API.
3. Only Delta, CSV and Parquet table data formats are supported by Fabric Lakehouse.
