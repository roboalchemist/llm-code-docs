## Install the connector[​](#install-the-connector "Direct link to Install the connector")

power bi versions

The Power BI connector may be incompatible with older versions of Power BI desktop. For the best results, we recommend installing the most recent version directly from the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9ntxr16hnw1t?hl=en-US\&gl=US) or [Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494).

The Semantic Layer Power BI connector consists of a custom `.pqx` Power BI connector and an ODBC driver. Install both using our Windows installer by following these steps:

1. Download and install the [`.msi` installer](https://github.com/dbt-labs/semantic-layer-powerbi-connector/releases/download/v1.0.0/dbt.Semantic.Layer.for.Power.BI.zip)

2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install the ODBC driver and connector onto your Power BI Desktop.

### Verify installation[​](#verify-installation "Direct link to Verify installation")

Note that users on older versions of Power BI may have to [configure the connector](#configure-the-connector) before they can verify the installation.

To verify the installation:

1. Open **ODBC Data Sources (64-bit)** file on your computer.
2. Navigate to **System DSN** and verify that the `dbt Labs ODBC DSN` is registered.
3. Navigate to **Drivers** and verify that the `dbt Labs ODBC Driver` is installed.
4. Open Power BI Desktop, navigate to **Settings**, then **Data Source Settings**. Verify that the `dbt Semantic Layer` connector is properly loaded.

To allow published reports in Power BI Service to use the connector. An IT admin in your organization needs to install and configure the connector on an On-premises Data Gateway.

## For IT admins[​](#for-it-admins "Direct link to For IT admins")

This section is for IT admins trying to install the ODBC driver and connector into an On-premises Data Gateway.

To allow published reports to use the connector in Power BI Service, an IT Admin must install and configure the connector:

1. Install the ODBC driver and connector into an On-premises Data Gateway. Run the same `.msi` installer used for Power BI Desktop and install it on the machine where your gateway is hosted.

2. Copy connector file to Gateway directory:

   <!-- -->

   1. Locate that `.pqx` file: `C:\Users\<YourUser>\Documents\Power BI Desktop\Custom Connectors\dbtSemanticLayer.pqx`.
   2. Copy it to the Power BI On-premises Data Gateway custom connectors directory: `C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\PBIEgwService\Documents\Power BI Desktop\Custom Connectors`.

3. Verify installation by following the steps from the [install the connector](#verify-installation) section.

4. Enable connector in Power BI Enterprise Gateway:

   <!-- -->

   1. Open the `EnterpriseGatewayConfigurator.exe`.
   2. Navigate to **Connectors**.
   3. Verify that the `dbt Semantic Layer` connector is installed and active.

For more information on how to set up custom connectors in the Power BI On-premises Data Gateway, refer to Power BI’s [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/service-gateway-custom-connectors).

## Configure the connector[​](#configure-the-connector "Direct link to Configure the connector")

After installing the connector, you’ll have to configure your project credentials to connect to the Semantic Layer from a report.

To configure project credentials in Power BI Desktop:

1. Create a blank report.

2. On the top-left, click on **Get data**.

3. Search for Semantic Layer, then click **Connect**.

4. Fill in your connection details. You can find your Host and Environment ID under the Semantic Layer configuration for your dbt project.

   <!-- -->

   tip

   Make sure you select **DirectQuery** under **Data Connectivity mode** since the Semantic Layer connector does not support **Import** mode. See [Considerations](#considerations) for more details.

5. Click **OK** to proceed.
   <!-- -->
   [![Select DirectQuery mode](/img/docs/cloud-integrations/sl-pbi/pbi-directquery.jpg?v=2 "Select DirectQuery mode")](#)Select DirectQuery mode

6. On the next screen, paste your service or personal token and then click **Connect**.

7. You should see a side pane with a few "virtual" tables. `ALL` represents all of your defined semantic layer objects. The other tables represent each of your saved queries. Select the one you want to load into your dashboard. Then click **Load**.
   <!-- -->
   [![Select tables in the side panel](/img/docs/cloud-integrations/sl-pbi/pbi-sidepanel.jpg?v=2 "Select tables in the side panel")](#)Select tables in the side panel

Now that you've configured the connector, you can configure published reports in the next section to use the connector.

## Configure published reports[​](#configure-published-reports "Direct link to Configure published reports")

After publishing a report and the first time you hit **Publish** on a given report, configure Power BI Service to use your organization’s On-premises Data Gateway to access data from the Semantic Layer:

1. On the top right, click on **Settings > Power BI settings**.
   <!-- -->
   [![Navigate to Settings > Power BI Settings](/img/docs/cloud-integrations/sl-pbi/pbi-settings.jpg?v=2 "Navigate to Settings > Power BI Settings")](#)Navigate to Settings > Power BI Settings

2. Navigate to the **Semantic models** tab and select your report on the sidebar on the left.

3. Under **Gateway and cloud connections**, select the **On-premises Data Gateway** where your IT admin has installed the Semantic Layer connector.

   <!-- -->

   * If the Status is **Not configured correctly**, you’ll have to configure it.

   [![Configure the gateway connection](/img/docs/cloud-integrations/sl-pbi/pbi-gateway-cloud-connections.jpg?v=2 "Configure the gateway connection")](#)Configure the gateway connection

4. Click on the arrow under **Actions** and then, click on **Manually add to gateway**.
   <!-- -->
   [![Manually add to gateway](/img/docs/cloud-integrations/sl-pbi/pbi-manual-gateway.jpg?v=2 "Manually add to gateway")](#)Manually add to gateway

5. Provide a name for your connection and enter your connection details.

   <!-- -->

   * Set the connection as **Encrypted** (Required). Failing to do so will result in the Semantic Layer servers rejecting the connection.

   [![Set the connection as Encrypted](/img/docs/cloud-integrations/sl-pbi/pbi-encrypted.jpg?v=2 "Set the connection as Encrypted")](#)Set the connection as Encrypted

6. Click **Create**. This will run a connection test (unless you choose to skip it). If the connection succeeds, the connection will be saved.

You can now go back to your published report on Power BI Service to assert data loads as expected.

## Use the connector[​](#use-the-connector "Direct link to Use the connector")

This section describes how to use the Semantic Layer connector in Power BI.

The Semantic Layer connector creates:

* A virtual table for each saved query.
* A `METRICS.ALL` table containing all metrics, and dimensions and entities appear as regular dimension columns.

These tables do not actually map to an underlying table in your data warehouse. Instead, Power BI sends queries to these tables and (before actually executing on the warehouse) the Semantic Layer servers:

* Parse the SQL.
* Extract all the queried columns, group bys and filters.
* Generates SQL to query your existing tables.
* Returns data back to Power BI, which doesn’t know any of this happened.

[![Power BI integration diagram](/img/docs/cloud-integrations/sl-pbi/sl-pbi.jpg?v=2 "Power BI integration diagram")](#)Power BI integration diagram

This allows for very flexible analytics workflows, like drag and drop metrics and slice by dimensions and entities — the Semantic Layer will generate the appropriate SQL to actually query your data source for you.

#### Modifying time granularity[​](#modifying-time-granularity "Direct link to Modifying time granularity")

<!-- -->

When you select time dimensions in the **Group By** menu, you'll see a list of available time granularities. The lowest granularity is selected by default. Metric time is the default time dimension for grouping your metrics.

info

Note: [Custom time granularities](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metricflow-time-spine.md#add-custom-granularities) (like fiscal year) aren't currently supported or accessible in this integration. Only [standard granularities](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/dimensions.md?dimension=time_gran#time) (like day, week, month, and so on) are available. If you'd like to access custom granularities, consider using the [Semantic Layer APIs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-api-overview.md).

## Considerations[​](#considerations "Direct link to Considerations")

 Not every “column” of METRICS.ALL are compatible with every other column

* `METRICS.ALL` combines all your existing metrics, entities and dimensions. Queries must be valid Semantic Layer queries, otherwise they'll fail with MetricFlow query compilation errors.

* For saved query tables, all “columns” will be compatible with every other “column” since, by definition, saved queries are valid queries that can be sliced by any of the dimensions present in the query.

 The dbt Semantic Layer connector does not support Import mode natively

* Use `DirectQuery` mode to ensure compatibility.

* `Import` mode tries to select an entire table to import into Power BI, which means it'll likely generate SQL that translates to an invalid Semantic Layer query which will try to query all metrics, dimensions and entities at the same time.

* To import data into a PowerBI report, select a valid combination of columns to import, (something that will generate a valid Semantic Layer query).

  <!-- -->

  * You can use `Table.SelectColumns` for this: `= Table.SelectColumns(Source{[Item="ALL",Schema="METRICS",Catalog=null]}[Data], {"Total Profit", "Metric Time (Day)"})`
  * Be aware that all calculations will happen inside of Power BI and won’t pass through Semantic Layer servers. This could lead to incorrect or diverging results.
  * For example, the Semantic Layer is usually responsible for rolling up cumulative metrics to coarser time granularities. Doing a sum over all the weeks in a year to get a yearly granularity out of a weekly Semantic Layer query will most likely generate incorrect results. Instead, you should query the Semantic Layer directly to get accurate results.

 The dbt Semantic Layer connector ignores aggregations defined in Power BI

* If you change the aggregation type of a metric from `SUM()` to `COUNT()` or anything else, nothing will change. This is because aggregation functions are defined in the Semantic Layer and we ignore them when translating Power BI generated SQL into Semantic Layer queries.
* Aggregations like `Count (Distinct)`, `Standard Deviation`, `Variance`, and `Median` in Power BI may return an error and not work at all.

 What actions aren't supported?

The following are not supported:

* Custom modeling
* Joining tables
* Creating custom columns within a table
* Custom Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) or Power Query (PQ)
