# About var function

<!-- -->

To retrieve a variable inside a model, hook, or macro, use the `var()` function. The `var()` function returns the value defined in your project or passed using `--vars`, based on precedence.

You can use `var()` anywhere dbt renders Jinja during compilation, including most `.sql` and `.yml` files in your project. It does not work in configuration files that dbt reads before compilation, such as [`profiles.yml`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/profiles-yml-context.md) or [`packages.yml`](<https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/packages.yml context.md>).

To add a variable to a model, use the `var()` function:

my\_model.sql

```sql
select * from events where event_type = '{{ var("event_type") }}'
```

If you try to run this model without supplying an `event_type` variable, you'll receive a compilation error that looks like this:

```text
Encountered an error:
! Compilation error while compiling model package_name.my_model:
! Required var 'event_type' not found in config:
Vars supplied to package_name.my_model = {
}
```

<!-- -->

### Variable default values[​](#variable-default-values "Direct link to Variable default values")

The `var()` function takes an optional second argument, `default`. If this argument is provided, then it will be the default value for the variable if one is not explicitly defined.

my\_model.sql

```sql
-- Use 'activation' as the event_type if the variable is not defined.
select * from events where event_type = '{{ var("event_type", "activation") }}'
```

### Command line variables[​](#command-line-variables "Direct link to Command line variables")

<!-- -->

The `dbt_project.yml` file is a great place to define variables that rarely change.

When you need to override a variable for a specific run, use the `--vars` command line option. For example, when you want to test with a different date range, run models with environment-specific settings, or adjust behavior dynamically.

Use `--vars` to pass one or more variables to a dbt command. Provide the argument as a YAML dictionary string.

For example:

```text
$ dbt run --vars '{"event_type": "signup"}'
```

Inside a model or macro, access the value using the `var()` function:

```text
select '{{ var("event_type") }}' as event_type
```

When you pass variables using `--vars`, you can access them anywhere you use the `var()` function in your project.

You can pass multiple variables at once:

```text
$ dbt run --vars '{event_type: signup, region: us}'
```

If only one variable is being set, the brackets are optional:

```text
$ dbt run --vars 'event_type: signup'
```

The `--vars` argument accepts a YAML dictionary as a string on the command line. YAML is convenient because it does not require strict quoting as with JSON.

Both of the following are valid and equivalent:

```text
$ dbt run --vars '{"key": "value", "date": 20180101}'
$ dbt run --vars '{key: value, date: 20180101}'
```

Variables defined using `--var`, override values defined in `dbt_project.yml`. This makes `--vars` useful for temporarily overriding configuration without changing your committed project files. For the complete order of precedence (including package-scoped variables and default values defined in `var()`), see [Variable precedence](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/project-variables.md#variable-precedence).
