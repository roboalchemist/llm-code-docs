## Types of API access tokens[​](#types-of-api-access-tokens "Direct link to Types of API access tokens")

**Personal access tokens:** Preferred and secure way of accessing dbt APIs on behalf of a user. PATs are scoped to an account and can be enhanced with more granularity and control.

**Service tokens:** Service tokens are similar to service accounts and are the preferred method to enable access on behalf of the dbt account.

### Which token type should you use[​](#which-token-type-should-you-use "Direct link to Which token type should you use")

You should use service tokens broadly for any production workflow where you need a service account. You should use PATs only for developmental workflows *or* dbt client workflows that require user context. The following examples show you when to use a personal access token (PAT) or a service token:

* **Connecting a partner integration to dbt** — Some examples include the [Semantic Layer Google Sheets integration](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud-integrations/avail-sl-integrations.md), Hightouch, Datafold, a custom app you’ve created, etc. These types of integrations should use a service token instead of a PAT because service tokens give you visibility, and you can scope them to only what the integration needs and ensure the least privilege. We highly recommend switching to a service token if you’re using a personal access token for these integrations today.
* **Production Terraform** — Use a service token since this is a production workflow and is acting as a service account and not a user account.
* **dbt CLI** — Use a PAT since the dbt CLI works within the context of a user (the user is making the requests and has to operate within the context of their user account).
* **Testing a custom script and staging Terraform or Postman** — We recommend using a PAT as this is a developmental workflow and is scoped to the user making the changes. When you push this script or Terraform into production, use a service token instead.
* **API endpoints requiring user context** — Use PATs to authenticate to any API endpoint that requires user context (for example, endpoints to create and update user credentials).
