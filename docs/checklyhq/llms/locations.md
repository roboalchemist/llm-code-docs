# Locations

> Learn about Public and Private locations using Checkly

**Locations** represent the global vantage points from which Checkly tests and monitors your applications. You can configure your tests and checks to run from an ever growing amount of global locations. Leveraging global infrastructure allows us to measure what the user experience is in different parts of the world.

## What are Locations?

Think of **Locations** as your monitoring outposts distributed around the globe. Each Location represents a geographic point where Checkly can execute your Checks, simulating the experience of users in that region. This geographic distribution is crucial because it reveals how your application performs for users regardless of where they're accessing it from.

You can select one or more data center locations to run your checks from. We advise to always select at least 2 locations. There are two reasons for this:

* Redundancy: we might have an issue in one location, but not the other.
* Retrying: if your check fails, we will execute its retry strategy where you have the option check from a different location.

## Public Locations

You can configure your run checks to run from an ever growing amount of global locations. Leveraging global infrastructure allows us to measure what the user experience is in different parts of the world.

Current Locations in Checkly are:

| Americas                       | Europe / Middle East / Africa | Asia Pacific               |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| North Virginia (us-east-1)\*   | Ireland (eu-west-1)           | Singapore (ap-southeast-1) |
| Ohio (us-east-2)               | Frankfurt (eu-central-1)\*    | Tokyo (ap-northeast-1)     |
| North California (us-west-1)\* | London (eu-west-2)\*          | Osaka (ap-northeast-3)     |
| Oregon (us-west-2)             | Paris (eu-west-3)             | Hong Kong (ap-east-1)      |
| Montreal (ca-central-1)        | Stockholm (eu-north-1)        | Sydney (ap-southeast-2)    |
| São Paulo (sa-east-1)          | Milan (eu-south-1)            | Seoul (ap-northeast-2)     |
|                                | Bahrain (me-south-1)          | Mumbai (ap-south-1)        |
|                                | Cape Town (af-south-1)        | Jakarta (ap-southeast-3)   |

\*Checkly hosted location. All other locations run on AWS. Please note that the hosting provider for a location may change over time as we scale and optimize our infrastructure.

## Private Locations

**Private Locations** extend this concept to your own infrastructure. A **Private Location** is a monitoring location that you manage by simply deploying a lightweight Checkly Agent. Running a check from a **Private Location** allows you to monitor internal systems and test the performance and reliability of applications and APIs that are only accessible from within your network.

## Locations as User Experience Proxies

Ultimately, Locations are about empathy for your users. They ensure that your monitoring perspective matches your users' reality. A user in Tokyo may have a vastly different experience than someone in New York, and **Locations** help you understand and optimize for these differences. They transform monitoring from a single-perspective activity into a truly global understanding of application performance and reliability.
