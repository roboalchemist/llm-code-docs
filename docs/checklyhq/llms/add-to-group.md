# Adding Playwright Check Suites to Groups

> Organize your Playwright Check Suites with groups for better management and shared configuration.

<Accordion title="Prerequisites">
  You need:

  * A repository using the Checkly CLI
  * At least one Playwright Check Suite defined in your repository.
</Accordion>

Groups organize checks and share configuration across them. See the [Groups overview](/platform/groups) for details on benefits and how groups work.

## 1. Create a group

Create a new file to define your group.

```typescript website-group.check.ts theme={null}
import { CheckGroupV2 } from 'checkly/constructs'

export const myGroup = new CheckGroupV2('production-group', {
  name: 'Production group',
  activated: true,
  muted: false,
  locations: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1'],
  tags: ['production', 'playwright'],
  environmentVariables: [],
})
```

<Tip>
  Learn more about [using groups](/constructs/check-group-v2).
</Tip>

## 2. Add a Playwright Check Suite to the group

Import the group and reference it in your Playwright Check Suite configuration:

```typescript checkly.config.ts highlight={2,14} theme={null}
import { defineConfig } from 'checkly'
import { myGroup } from './website-group.check'

export default defineConfig({
  logicalId: 'checkly-website',
  projectName: 'checkly-website',
  checks: {
    playwrightConfigPath: './playwright.config.ts',
    playwrightChecks: [
      {
        name: 'Critical Tests',
        logicalId: 'critical-tests',
        pwTags:'critical',
        frequency: 10,
        locations: ['us-east-1',],
        group: myGroup,
      },
    ],
  },
})
```

## 3. Deploy your changes

```bash  theme={null}
npx checkly deploy --preview # preview what will be deployed
npx checkly deploy           # deploy the new scheduled Playwright Check Suites into the group
```

Your Playwright Check Suite now appears in the group in your [Checkly Home Dashboard](https://app.checklyhq.com/).

## Add multiple check suites to one group

Add multiple Playwright Check Suites to the same group while keeping individual test selection and frequency settings. Reference the group in each suite:

```typescript checkly.config.ts highlight={2,13,20,27} theme={null}
import { defineConfig } from 'checkly'
import { myGroup } from './website-group.check'

export default defineConfig({
  logicalId: 'checkly-website',
  projectName: 'checkly-website',
  checks: {
    playwrightConfigPath: './playwright.config.ts',
    playwrightChecks: [
      {
        name: 'Critical User Flows',
        logicalId: 'critical-flows',
        pwTags: 'critical',
        frequency: 5,
        group: myGroup,
      },
      {
        name: 'Authentication Tests',
        logicalId: 'auth-tests',
        pwTags: 'auth',
        frequency: 10,
        group: myGroup,
      },
      {
        name: 'Checkout Flow',
        logicalId: 'checkout-flow',
        pwTags: 'checkout',
        frequency: 5,
        group: myGroup,
      },
    ],
  },
})
```
