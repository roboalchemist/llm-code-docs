# checkly switch

> Switch between multiple Checkly accounts.

The `checkly switch` command switches between multiple Checkly accounts that you have access to with your current credentials. Useful when you need to manage monitoring across different organizations or environments.

<Accordion title="Prerequisites">
  Before using `checkly switch`, ensure you have:

  * Valid Checkly account authentication (run `npx checkly login` if needed)
  * Access to multiple Checkly accounts (team memberships, client projects, etc.)

  If you only have access to one account, this command will indicate no alternative accounts are available.
</Accordion>

## Usage

The basic command displays available accounts and provides an interactive selection interface.

```bash Terminal theme={null}
npx checkly switch [options]
```

| Option             | Required | Description                                  |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `--account-id, -a` | -        | The id of the account you want to switch to. |

## Command Options

<ResponseField name="--account-id, -a" type="string">
  The `switch` command asks you to select an account interactively by default. Use this option to switch accounts non-interactively by specifying the target account ID directly.

  **Usage:**

  ```bash Terminal theme={null}
  npx checkly switch --account-id="a43....."
  npx checkly switch -a="a43....."
  ```

  ## Examples

    <Tab title="Standard Switch">
      ```bash Terminal theme={null}
      # Standard account switching
      npx checkly switch

      # Output
      ? Which account do you want to use?
        Production
        Staging
        Demo
        ...
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Automatic Switch">
      ```bash Terminal theme={null}
      # Verbose account switching with details
      npx checkly switch --account-id="a43....."

      # Output
      Account switched to "a43....."
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
</ResponseField>

## Troubleshooting

### No Alternative Accounts

If you see "No alternative accounts available":

* You only have access to one Checkly account
* Contact account administrators to request access to additional accounts
* Consider using separate authentication for different accounts

### Account Not Listed

If an expected account doesn't appear:

* Verify you have active access to that account
* Check that your user hasn't been removed from the account
* Try logging out and back in to refresh account permissions
