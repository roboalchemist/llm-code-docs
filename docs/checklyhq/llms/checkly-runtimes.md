# checkly runtimes

> List all available runtimes and their dependencies.

The `checkly runtimes` command displays all available runtime environments and their installed dependencies. This helps you understand what packages and versions are available for your checks in the Checkly cloud infrastructure.

<Tip>Learn more about Checkly runtimes in our [Runtimes documentation](/platform/runtimes/overview).</Tip>

## Usage

List all available runtimes with their dependency versions.

```bash Terminal theme={null}
npx checkly runtimes
```

Example output:

```bash Terminal theme={null}
[
  {
    "name": "2025.04",
    "description": "The main update is Playwright 1.51.1. The Node.js version is v22.11.0.",

export default defineConfig({
  projectName: 'My Project',
  checks: {
    runtimeId: '2025.04',
  }
  /* More options... */
})
```

Or in your runtime-dependent checks:

```typescript apicheck.ts highlight={5} theme={null}
import { ApiCheck } from 'checkly/constructs'

new ApiCheck('books-api-check-2', {
  name: 'Books API',
  runtimeId: '2025.04',
  /* More options... */
```

Or in your check groups:

```typescript checkgroup.check.ts highlight={5} theme={null}
import { CheckGroupV2 } from 'checkly/constructs'

const syntheticGroup = new CheckGroupV2('check-group-synthetics', {
  name: 'Synthetic Monitors Group',
  runtimeId: '2025.04',
  /* More options... */
})
```
