# Proxy Setup

> Configure HTTP proxies for Checkly Private Locations in enterprise environments. Set up proxy routing for both agent management traffic and check execution.

If you are operating our [Checkly Agent](/private-locations/) behind an HTTP proxy,
for example in an enterprise environment, you can use an outgoing proxy for all check traffic. We recommend using the following
setup.

> Note you can also define a proxy for management traffic from your private location to the Checkly API where we ingest
> your telemetry and management events. See [the environment variables available to the Checkly Agent container](/private-locations/checkly-agent-guide/#checkly-agent-environment-variables)

## Setting an HTTP proxy for your Private Location

We recommend storing the URL of your proxy in a [global environment variable](https://app.checklyhq.com/environment-variables)
so you can easily reuse it in your Private Location configuration and checks. In the example below we store it as `PROXY_URL`

After this, you can reference this variable using `{{PROXY_URL}}` in the Private Location configuration.

## Using an HTTP proxy

With the setup complete, any API check or uptime monitor which uses that Private Location will automatically inherit the proxy configuration for outgoing traffic.

## Using an HTTP proxy with Browser checks

You can enable your proxy directly in your browser checks via a few extra lines of code, using the `process.env.PROXY_URL`
notation and Playwright Test's `test.use()` method:

  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```typescript use-proxy.spec.ts theme={null}
    import { test } from '@playwright/test'

    test.use({
      proxy: {
        server: process.env.PROXY_URL
      }
    })

    test('Go to google.com', async ({ page }) => {
      await page.goto('https://google.com')
    })
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="JavaScript">
    ```javascript use-proxy.spec.js theme={null}
    const { test } = require('@playwright/test')

    test.use({
      proxy: {
        server: process.env.PROXY_URL
      }
    })

    test('Go to google.com', async ({ page }) => {
      await page.goto('https://google.com')
    })
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This is all that is required for a browser check to proxy all outbound network connections via your designated HTTP proxy.
