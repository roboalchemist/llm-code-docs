# Search UI
Search UI is a JavaScript library for building modern, customizable search experiences using Elastic as a backend. Maintained by the Elastic team, it helps you implement search interfaces with minimal boilerplate.
As a headless library, Search UI separates logic from presentation. It provides search state and actions you can use with React, vanilla JavaScript, or other frameworks like Vue.

## Get Started


### Installation

```sh

# or
yarn add @elastic/search-ui @elastic/react-search-ui @elastic/react-search-ui-views
```


### Tutorials 📘

<note>
  Search UI can connect to Serverless using a backend proxy. In this setup, the frontend uses the `ApiProxyConnector` to send requests to your backend, which then forwards them to Elasticsearch. Direct browser connections to Serverless are not supported due to CORS restrictions.[See our guide for using Search UI in production](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/search-ui/tutorials-elasticsearch-production-usage) for a full example of this setup.
