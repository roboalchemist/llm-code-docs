# File glob specification

File globs are used for configuring which files to include or exclude in various
contexts, allowing you to specifically define the files you want `momentic` to
include.

## Glob patterns

| Pattern     | Description                                                                                          |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `*`         | Match all files in the directory                                                                     |
| `**`        | Recursively match all files and sub-directories                                                      |
| `some-dir/` | Match the `some-dir` directory and its contents                                                      |
| `some-dir`  | Match a file named `some-dir` or a `some-dir` directory and its contents                             |
| `some-dir*` | Match files and directories that start with `some-dir`, including contents when matching a directory |
| `*.js`      | Match all `.js` files in the directory                                                               |
| `!`         | Negate the whole glob (automatically applies `/**` to the end of the defined glob)                   |
