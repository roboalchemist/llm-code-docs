# LLM Code Docs - Comprehensive Task List
# Each task is self-contained and executable by independent agents
# Format: [ ] = pending, [-] = in progress, [x] = complete

# ==============================================================================
# PHASE 0: CURRENT STATE VALIDATION (Task 0)
# ==============================================================================

[x] TASK 0: Validate current Notion extraction state and determine starting point. First check if Crawl4AI extraction already ran by examining: (1) git log --oneline | head -20 to see recent commits, (2) wc -c notion/block.md notion/page.md notion/database.md to check file sizes, (3) grep -ic "example.*block object" notion/block.md to count example matches (should be 0 if old extraction, >20 if Crawl4AI ran), (4) grep "^# Source:" notion/block.md to check for Crawl4AI source headers. DECISION LOGIC: If files show evidence of Crawl4AI (>45KB, >20 example matches, have source headers) then SKIP Tasks 1-3 and proceed directly to Task 4 for QA verification. If files are still incomplete (old extraction showing <45KB, 0-5 example matches, no source headers) then proceed with Task 1 as written. Document your decision and evidence in /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/notion-extraction-status.txt including exact file sizes, match counts, and which tasks to execute. Create the tmp directory if it doesn't exist: mkdir -p /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp.

# ==============================================================================
# PHASE 1: COMPLETE NOTION API DOCS EXTRACTION WITH CRAWL4AI (Tasks 1-8)
# ==============================================================================

[x] TASK 1: Test Crawl4AI extraction on 3 sample Notion pages and verify completeness. Check /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/notion-extraction-status.txt - if it says SKIP this task, skip to next task. The script /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts/notion-docs-crawl4ai.py has been created and needs testing. Run it with a modified version that ONLY processes these 3 URLs: https://developers.notion.com/reference/block, https://developers.notion.com/reference/page, https://developers.notion.com/reference/intro. BEFORE running, back up the existing files using git: cd /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs && git stash push -m 'Pre-crawl4ai extraction backup' notion/. Create a test version of the script at /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts/notion-docs-crawl4ai-test.py that only processes those 3 URLs (modify the load_urls() function to return a hardcoded list). Install crawl4ai if needed: pip install crawl4ai. Run the test script: cd /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts && python notion-docs-crawl4ai-test.py. After extraction completes, verify each file: 1) Check file sizes with 'wc -c /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/notion/block.md /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/notion/page.md /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/notion/intro.md' - block.md should be SIGNIFICANTLY larger than current 46,194 bytes (expect >100KB for complete content), page.md should be >15KB (currently 6,259 bytes), intro.md should be >15KB (currently 7,196 bytes). 2) Search for example patterns: grep -i "example.*block object" /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/notion/block.md should find MULTIPLE matches (currently finds 0). 3) Manually inspect block.md to verify collapsible sections are expanded - look for code examples, detailed object schemas, and property descriptions. 4) Check for JavaScript-rendered content completeness by comparing with live page at https://developers.notion.com/reference/block. If ANY file is smaller or incomplete, debug the Crawl4AI extraction logic: check the CSS selector (should target "article#content"), verify excluded_tags list, increase wait_for timeout if needed, or add explicit JavaScript to expand collapsibles. Document all findings in /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/notion-crawl4ai-test-results.txt including: file sizes before/after, grep match counts, visual inspection notes, and any issues found. DO NOT PROCEED to next task until all 3 files show complete extraction.

[x] TASK 2: Compare Crawl4AI extraction quality against current files and analyze differences. Check /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/notion-extraction-status.txt - if it says SKIP this task, skip to next task. After Task 1 completes successfully, perform detailed comparison: 1) Create comparison report at /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/notion-extraction-comparison.txt. 2) For each of the 3 test files (block.md, page.md, intro.md), document: original file size vs new file size (percentage increase), original line count vs new line count (use wc -l), number of code blocks in original vs new (grep -c '```' filename), number of example sections (grep -ic 'example' filename). 3) Identify specific content that was MISSING from original extraction - open both versions side-by-side and note major sections that are now present. Verify new extraction is actually BETTER by checking not just size but: more code examples found, more complete schema definitions, collapsible sections are expanded. 4) Check for any QUALITY issues in new extraction: broken markdown formatting, missing headers, garbled code examples, duplicate content. 5) Verify markdown rendering by checking: headers use proper # syntax, code blocks are properly fenced with ```, tables render correctly, lists are properly formatted, links are not broken. 6) Check source attribution - each file should start with "# Source: [URL]" header. 7) Test reading a few files to ensure they're human-readable and not corrupted. Document everything in the comparison report. If new files are significantly better (>50% larger with more examples and complete content) AND have no major quality issues, mark this task complete. If new files have quality problems, debug Crawl4AI config: adjust css_selector, modify excluded_tags, add post-processing cleanup. Include recommendation in report: "PROCEED to full extraction" or "NEEDS MORE DEBUGGING" with specific issues to fix.

[x] TASK 3: Run full Crawl4AI extraction on all 71 Notion API documentation pages. Check /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/notion-extraction-status.txt - if it says SKIP this task, skip to next task. This task should ONLY be executed if Task 2 concluded with "PROCEED to full extraction" recommendation. Read /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/notion-extraction-comparison.txt to verify. Before proceeding: 1) Create full backup of existing notion directory using git: cd /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs && git stash push -m 'Pre-full-crawl4ai extraction backup' notion/. 2) Check that /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts/notion-api-links.txt exists and contains all 71 URLs (use wc -l to count, should be ~75 lines including comments). 3) Review the main script /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts/notion-docs-crawl4ai.py to ensure it's configured correctly: cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS, css_selector="article#content", proper excluded_tags, wait_for="css:article#content", 0.3 second delay between requests. 4) Run the full extraction: cd /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts && python notion-docs-crawl4ai.py 2>&1 | tee /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/notion-full-extraction.log. 5) Monitor progress - script should show "[N/71]" progress for each page. 6) Wait for completion - this will take approximately 30-40 minutes (71 pages Ã— ~30 seconds each). 7) After completion, check the summary output for: number of successful extractions (should be 71/71), number of failed extractions (should be 0), total size of extracted content, average file size. 8) If any failures occurred, note which pages failed and why (check error messages in log). 9) Quick verification: cd /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/notion && ls -1 | wc -l (should show 71 files), du -sh . (should show >5MB total). Save completion timestamp and statistics to /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/notion-full-extraction-complete.txt. If there were failures, document them and determine if they need individual re-processing or if the script needs fixes.

[x] TASK 4: Perform comprehensive quality assurance on all 71 extracted Notion documentation files. This verifies the full extraction from Task 3 is complete and high-quality. 1) Generate file size report: cd /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/notion && ls -lh *.md | awk '{print $5, $9}' | sort -h > /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/notion-file-sizes.txt. Review this file to identify any suspiciously small files (<2KB might indicate incomplete extraction). 2) Check for empty or near-empty files: find /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/notion -name "*.md" -size -500c -exec ls -lh {} \;. Any files under 500 bytes are likely incomplete and need re-extraction. 3) Verify source headers: grep -L "^# Source:" /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/notion/*.md should return NO results (all files should have source header). 4) Sample 10 random files for content quality: shuf -n 10 -e /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/notion/*.md | while read f; do echo "=== $f ==="; head -50 "$f"; echo ""; done > /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/notion-random-samples.txt. Review this file to check markdown quality, presence of code examples, proper formatting. 5) Test critical files known to have issues in previous extractions - check these specific files for completeness: block.md (should be >100KB with multiple "Example" sections), page.md (should be >15KB), database.md (should be >15KB), create-a-data-source.md (should be >4KB), create-a-file-upload.md (should be >3KB), revoke-token.md (should be >2KB), introspect-token.md (should be >2KB). Use wc -c to verify sizes. 6) Verify example content presence: grep -l "example" -i /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/notion/*.md | wc -l should show majority of files (>50) contain examples. 7) Check for code blocks: grep -l '```' /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/notion/*.md | wc -l should show majority of files (>60) contain code examples. 8) Look for extraction artifacts that indicate problems: grep -r "javascript:" /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/notion/ (should find nothing), grep -r "void(0)" /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/notion/ (should find nothing). Create comprehensive QA report at /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/notion-qa-report.txt with: total files checked (should be 71), files passing size check, files passing content check, list of any problematic files needing re-extraction, overall quality assessment (PASS/FAIL), recommendations for any fixes needed. Only mark this task complete if QA report shows PASS with 0 problematic files.

[x] TASK 5: Handle any failed or incomplete extractions identified in Task 4 QA process. Read /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/notion-qa-report.txt to get list of problematic files. If report shows PASS with 0 issues, skip this task and mark it complete immediately with note "No issues found, skipping". If there ARE problematic files: 1) Create list of URLs that need re-extraction by looking up the slugs in /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts/notion-api-links.txt. For example, if block.md is incomplete, find the URL https://developers.notion.com/reference/block. 2) Create a targeted re-extraction script at /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts/notion-docs-crawl4ai-fixes.py that ONLY processes the problematic URLs. Copy the main script and modify load_urls() to return only the problematic URLs. 3) Consider if these pages need special handling - do they have unusual structure, extra JavaScript, more complex interactions? Review the live pages in browser if needed. 4) Modify extraction config for these problematic pages if needed: increase wait_for timeout to 5000ms, add explicit JavaScript to expand all collapsibles: page.evaluate('document.querySelectorAll("details").forEach(el => el.setAttribute("open", ""))'), add longer delay after page load: await asyncio.sleep(2) before extraction. 5) Run the fixes script: cd /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts && python notion-docs-crawl4ai-fixes.py 2>&1 | tee /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/notion-fixes-extraction.log. 6) After completion, re-run relevant checks from Task 4 on the fixed files to verify they're now complete. 7) Document the fixes in /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/notion-fixes-applied.txt: which files were fixed, what changes were made to extraction process, verification that fixes worked. If re-extraction still fails for any files, document the persistent issues and consider manual extraction or alternative approaches (Playwright with explicit interactions, LLM-based conversion, etc.). Only mark complete when all files pass QA or persistent issues are documented with manual intervention plan.

[x] TASK 6: Update project documentation to reflect new Crawl4AI-based extraction approach. After all Notion files are successfully extracted and verified (Tasks 1-5 complete): 1) Update /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/README.md: Find the Notion API section (search for "Notion API" or line ~19), replace the current content about known limitations and skipped JS-rendered pages with new content describing the Crawl4AI approach. New text should explain: "Notion API documentation is automatically extracted using Crawl4AI, a modern web crawling framework that handles JavaScript-rendered content. The extraction process fully renders all pages, expands collapsible sections, and converts to clean markdown. All 71 API reference pages are successfully extracted with complete content including examples, object schemas, and code samples." Update the script usage example to: "python3 update-scripts/notion-docs-crawl4ai.py". Remove the "Known Limitation" paragraph about 8 JS-rendered pages since Crawl4AI handles them. 2) Update PROJECT_SPEC.md: Change "Current Status" at top from "Major content incompleteness issue identified" to "COMPLETE - Full extraction successful using Crawl4AI". Update "Status" at bottom from "Awaiting implementation" to "COMPLETE - All 71 pages extracted with full content". Add new section under "Problem Solving Journey" > "Solved": "6. Implemented Crawl4AI-based extraction for complete content capture including JavaScript-rendered sections". 3) Create /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts/NOTION_CRAWL4AI_IMPLEMENTATION.md to document the final approach: Include overview of Crawl4AI solution, configuration details (CSS selectors, excluded tags, wait conditions), testing methodology (3 sample pages first), results (file sizes, content completeness metrics), comparison with previous approaches (requests/BeautifulSoup, Playwright), lessons learned. 4) Verify all documentation is accurate by reviewing what you wrote - check that script names, file paths, and commands are correct.

[x] TASK 7: Clean up old Notion extraction scripts and obsolete files now that Crawl4AI approach is working. The repository has outdated scripts from previous extraction attempts that should be archived or removed: 1) List all Notion-related scripts: ls -lh /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts/notion*.py to see what exists. 2) Identify scripts to clean up - likely includes: notion-docs.py (original HTTP-based extractor with known incompleteness issues), notion-docs-playwright.py (Playwright attempt that still had issues), notion-docs-crawl4ai-test.py (test script from Task 1), notion-docs-crawl4ai-fixes.py (fixes script from Task 5, if it exists). 3) DO NOT delete notion-docs-crawl4ai.py - this is the working script to keep. 4) Create archive directory: mkdir -p /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts/archive. 5) Move old scripts to archive: mv /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts/notion-docs.py /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts/archive/ && mv /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts/notion-docs-playwright.py /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts/archive/. Move test/fix scripts too if they exist. 6) Check for obsolete documentation files that reference old approaches: find /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts -name "*NOTION*.md" -o -name "*notion*.md". Review NOTION_JS_RENDERED_FIX.md and similar files - if they document problems that Crawl4AI solved, move them to archive as well. 7) Update /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts/README.md if it exists to reflect that notion-docs-crawl4ai.py is the current script. 8) Clean up temporary files from testing: rm /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/notion-crawl4ai-test-results.txt /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/notion-extraction-comparison.txt /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/notion-full-extraction.log /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/notion-full-extraction-complete.txt /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/notion-file-sizes.txt /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/notion-random-samples.txt /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/notion-qa-report.txt if they exist (but keep extraction status file and any backups for a while in case rollback is needed). 9) Verify the repository is clean: ls /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts/*.py should show only active, working scripts. Document what was cleaned up in /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/notion-cleanup-summary.txt.

[x] TASK 8: Commit and document the completed Notion API extraction work. After all previous tasks (1-7) are complete: 1) Check git status to see all changes: cd /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs && git status. You should see: Modified files in notion/ directory (all 71 .md files), modified README.md, modified PROJECT_SPEC.md, new file update-scripts/NOTION_CRAWL4AI_IMPLEMENTATION.md, moved files in update-scripts/archive/, possibly modified update-scripts/notion-docs-crawl4ai.py if you made tweaks. 2) Review a sample of changes to verify quality: git diff notion/block.md | head -100 to see what changed in a key file. 3) Determine actual file size changes before committing using: cd /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/notion && wc -c block.md page.md database.md to get current sizes for commit message. 4) Stage the changes in logical groups: git add notion/*.md (all documentation updates), git add README.md PROJECT_SPEC.md (documentation updates), git add update-scripts/NOTION_CRAWL4AI_IMPLEMENTATION.md (new docs), git add update-scripts/notion-docs-crawl4ai.py (script), git add update-scripts/archive/ (cleanup). 5) Create detailed commit message documenting the work with actual file sizes calculated in step 3: git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Complete Notion API documentation extraction using Crawl4AI

Replaces incomplete extraction with full content capture using Crawl4AI
framework, which properly handles JavaScript-rendered content and
expands all collapsible sections.

Changes:
- Updated all 71 Notion API documentation files with complete content
- File sizes significantly increased (e.g., block.md: [ACTUAL_OLD_SIZE] â†’ [ACTUAL_NEW_SIZE])
- All example sections, code blocks, and object schemas now captured
- Created notion-docs-crawl4ai.py as new extraction script
- Archived old scripts (notion-docs.py, notion-docs-playwright.py)
- Updated README.md to document new extraction approach
- Updated PROJECT_SPEC.md status to COMPLETE
- Added implementation documentation in NOTION_CRAWL4AI_IMPLEMENTATION.md

Testing:
- Validated on 3 sample pages (block.md, page.md, intro.md)
- QA performed on all 71 files for size, content, and formatting
- All files pass completeness checks with examples and schemas present

)")" (Replace [ACTUAL_OLD_SIZE] and [ACTUAL_NEW_SIZE] with the actual values from step 3). 6) Verify commit looks correct: git log -1 --stat to see commit with file changes. 7) Push to remote: git push origin master. 8) Verify push succeeded: git status should show "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'".


# ==============================================================================
# PHASE 2: PERPLEXITY DOCS EXTRACTION (Tasks 9-15)
# ==============================================================================

[x] TASK 9: Research Perplexity documentation structure and determine optimal extraction approach. The goal is to extract comprehensive documentation from https://docs.perplexity.ai following the pattern established by successful scripts (claude-code-sdk-docs.py and notion-docs-crawl4ai.py). Steps: 1) Use Playwright MCP tools to navigate to https://docs.perplexity.ai: call mcp__playwright__playwright_navigate with url="https://docs.perplexity.ai", headless=false, width=1280, height=720. 2) Take screenshot to see the page structure: mcp__playwright__playwright_screenshot with name="perplexity-home", savePng=true. 3) Get the visible HTML to examine structure: mcp__playwright__playwright_get_visible_html with cleanHtml=true, removeScripts=true. Save output to /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/perplexity-structure.html. 4) Analyze the HTML to identify: Where is the main navigation/sidebar? (look for nav elements, sidebar classes, menu structures), What CSS selectors identify documentation links? (e.g., a.doc-link, nav a[href^="/docs/"], etc.), How are pages structured? (what's the main content container - article, main, .content, etc.), Is it a static site or JavaScript-rendered SPA? (check if content is in initial HTML or loaded dynamically). 5) Try navigating to a few sample documentation pages to understand URL structure: Use playwright_navigate to go to different sections, note URL patterns (e.g., /docs/api-reference, /docs/getting-started, etc.), check if pages follow consistent structure. 6) Examine a sample page in detail: Take screenshot, get HTML, identify the exact CSS selector for main content area, check for navigation elements, code examples, collapsible sections. 7) Use Perplexity API via mcp__perplexity__perplexity_ask to research: "What is the best approach to extract documentation from docs.perplexity.ai? Is it a static site or JavaScript-rendered? What tools work best?" 8) Document findings in /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/perplexity-research.txt including: Total estimated number of documentation pages, URL pattern for pages, CSS selector for main content, CSS selector for navigation links, Whether it's static or needs JavaScript rendering, Recommended extraction approach (simple HTTP requests + BeautifulSoup, or Crawl4AI for JS rendering, or Playwright), Any special considerations (authentication, rate limiting, dynamic content, etc.). 9) Close Playwright: mcp__playwright__playwright_close. Only mark this task complete once you have a clear extraction strategy documented.

[x] TASK 10: Extract Perplexity documentation sidebar links to get complete list of pages. Based on research from Task 9 (read /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/perplexity-research.txt for strategy): 1) Create script /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts/extract-perplexity-sidebar.py to extract all documentation links from the site. 2) The script should: Navigate to https://docs.perplexity.ai, wait for page to fully load (if JavaScript-rendered), find all documentation links in sidebar/navigation using appropriate CSS selectors identified in Task 9, extract href attributes and convert to absolute URLs, filter to only include actual documentation pages (exclude external links, social media, etc.), deduplicate URLs, save to /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts/perplexity-docs-links.txt. 3) If the site is static, use requests + BeautifulSoup approach (similar to claude-code-sdk pattern). If JavaScript-rendered, use Playwright MCP tools (similar to pattern in Task 9). 4) Run the extraction: cd /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts && python extract-perplexity-sidebar.py. 5) Verify the output file: cat perplexity-docs-links.txt to review URLs, wc -l perplexity-docs-links.txt to count (expect 20-50 pages typically for API docs), check that URLs are valid and follow expected pattern. 6) Manually verify completeness by comparing with what you see in browser - did the script capture all major sections? (API Reference, Guides, Tutorials, etc.) 7) Add header comments to the links file: prepend "# Perplexity Documentation Links\n# Automatically extracted from sidebar navigation\n# Generated on [timestamp]\n# Total pages: N\n". 8) If extraction missed sections or has issues, debug and re-run until you have comprehensive link list. Document link extraction method in /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/perplexity-links-extraction.txt for reference.

[x] TASK 11: Create and test Perplexity documentation extraction script. Based on successful patterns from claude-code-sdk-docs.py and notion-docs-crawl4ai.py: 1) Create /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts/perplexity-docs.py with the following features: Load URLs from perplexity-docs-links.txt, support --cached flag to use existing links vs fresh extraction (like claude-code-sdk pattern), extract main content using approach determined in Task 9 (HTTP+BeautifulSoup for static, Crawl4AI for JavaScript-rendered), use appropriate CSS selector for main content area identified in Task 9, add source URL header to each extracted file ("# Source: [URL]"), save files to /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/perplexity/ directory, preserve any hierarchical structure in URLs (e.g., /api/models â†’ api/models.md or api-models.md), include progress tracking showing [N/total] for each page, add delay between requests (0.3-0.5 seconds) to be respectful, report statistics at end (successful, failed, total size). 2) If using Crawl4AI approach, base it on notion-docs-crawl4ai.py with appropriate modifications for Perplexity's structure. If using HTTP approach, base it on claude-code-sdk-docs.py pattern. 3) Create test version first: /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts/perplexity-docs-test.py that only processes 3 sample URLs (pick from beginning, middle, end of links list to get variety). 4) Run test extraction: cd /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts && python perplexity-docs-test.py 2>&1 | tee /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/perplexity-test.log. 5) Verify test output: Check that /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/perplexity/ directory was created, check that 3 test files exist and are reasonable size (>1KB each), read one file to verify markdown quality, check for source header, look for code examples and proper formatting, verify no HTML artifacts or broken markdown. 6) If test extraction has quality issues, debug: adjust CSS selectors, improve HTML cleaning, fix markdown conversion, add post-processing if needed. 7) Document the extraction approach in /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/perplexity-extraction-approach.txt: what method was used (HTTP vs Crawl4AI), what CSS selectors, any special processing needed, example of output quality. Only proceed to next task when test extraction produces high-quality markdown files.

[x] TASK 12: Run full Perplexity documentation extraction and verify quality. After Task 11 test extraction succeeds: 1) Review the working perplexity-docs-test.py to understand the approach. 2) Finalize /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts/perplexity-docs.py to process ALL URLs from perplexity-docs-links.txt (remove any test-only URL filtering). 3) Run full extraction: cd /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts && python perplexity-docs.py 2>&1 | tee /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/perplexity-full-extraction.log. 4) Monitor progress - should show [N/total] for each page processed. Expected duration depends on number of pages (count from wc -l perplexity-docs-links.txt), probably 10-30 minutes. 5) After completion, check summary statistics: number successful should equal total pages in links file, number failed should be 0, total size should be >1MB for substantial documentation. 6) Perform quality verification: cd /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/perplexity && ls -1 *.md | wc -l (should match total pages), du -sh . (check total size), ls -lh *.md | sort -k5 -h | head (check for suspiciously small files <1KB), sample random files to check quality: shuf -n 5 -e *.md | while read f; do echo "=== $f ==="; head -30 "$f"; done. 7) Verify source headers: grep -L "^# Source:" *.md should return nothing. 8) Check for code examples presence: grep -l '```' *.md | wc -l should show most files have code blocks. 9) Look for extraction artifacts: grep -r "javascript:" . (should be none), grep -r "class=" . | head (should be minimal or none). 10) Create QA report at /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/perplexity-qa-report.txt documenting: total files extracted, file size distribution (min/max/average), content quality assessment (good/issues found), any problematic files needing attention, overall status (PASS/FAIL). 11) If any files are incomplete or problematic, identify them and consider re-extraction with adjusted parameters. Only mark complete when QA report shows PASS with all files successfully extracted.

[x] TASK 13: Handle any issues from Perplexity extraction and create usage documentation. Read /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/perplexity-qa-report.txt to check status. If PASS with no issues, skip to documentation creation. If there are problematic files: 1) Identify root causes - are certain pages different structure? More JavaScript? Authentication needed? Special formatting? 2) Create targeted fixes in /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts/perplexity-docs-fixes.py for problematic URLs. 3) Apply fixes and verify results. 4) Update QA report to reflect fixes. Once all files are good: 5) Create /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts/PERPLEXITY_EXTRACTION_NOTES.md documenting: Overview of Perplexity documentation structure, extraction method used (HTTP vs Crawl4AI), CSS selectors and configuration, total pages extracted, file size statistics, any special handling required, known limitations if any, maintenance instructions (how to update). 6) Test the script end-to-end with --cached flag (if implemented): python perplexity-docs.py --cached should run successfully using existing links file. 7) Verify script is robust: handles network errors gracefully, provides clear error messages, can resume if interrupted (or at least fails gracefully). Document any improvements made in the notes file.

# ==============================================================================
# PHASE 3: OPENROUTER MODELS API EXTRACTION (Tasks 16-20)
# ==============================================================================

[x] TASK 16: Research OpenRouter API structure and create models extraction script. The goal is to get a complete listing of all available models from OpenRouter API. Steps: 1) First verify OPENROUTER_API_KEY exists: echo $OPENROUTER_API_KEY. If not found, check common locations: grep -r "OPENROUTER_API_KEY" ~/.bashrc ~/.zshrc ~/.profile ~/.bash_profile 2>/dev/null. If still not found, document as blocker in /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/openrouter-blocker.txt and cannot proceed with OpenRouter tasks - notify user that OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable must be set. If key is found, proceed. 2) Research the OpenRouter API documentation - use Perplexity to ask: "What is the OpenRouter API endpoint to get a list of all available models? What authentication is required? What is the response format?" Save response to /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/openrouter-research.txt. 3) Alternatively/additionally, check OpenRouter API docs at https://openrouter.ai/docs using Playwright: mcp__playwright__playwright_navigate url="https://openrouter.ai/docs", take screenshot, get HTML, look for API endpoints section. 4) Test API access with simple curl command: curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENROUTER_API_KEY" https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models (adjust URL based on research). Save response to /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/openrouter-test-response.json. 5) Examine the response format: cat /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/openrouter-test-response.json | python -m json.tool | head -50 to see structure. Identify: where is the models array/list? what fields does each model have? (id, name, description, pricing, context length, etc.), is pagination required?, any rate limits to consider? 6) Based on findings, create /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts/openrouter-models.py with features: fetch complete model list from OpenRouter API, use OPENROUTER_API_KEY from environment variable, handle pagination if required, extract relevant model information (id, name, description, pricing, context window, etc.), format as clean markdown or JSON (decide based on usability), save to /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/openrouter/ directory, include timestamp and source attribution, include error handling for API failures, include retry logic with exponential backoff for rate limits. 7) Document the script design in /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/openrouter-script-design.txt: API endpoint used, authentication method, response format, how pagination is handled (if applicable), output format (markdown or JSON), what information is extracted for each model.

[x] TASK 17: Implement and test OpenRouter models extraction script. Based on design from Task 16 (read /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/openrouter-script-design.txt): 1) Complete implementation of /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts/openrouter-models.py. Script should: import os, sys, requests, json, time from pathlib import Path, get API key: api_key = os.getenv('OPENROUTER_API_KEY'), validate API key exists or exit with helpful error, define API endpoint (from research), create function to fetch models with proper headers and error handling, create function to format models data (either as markdown table/list or structured JSON), create main() function that: fetches models, formats output, saves to /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/openrouter/models.[md|json], prints summary statistics (total models, categories, etc.). 2) Add helpful features: --json flag to output as JSON instead of markdown (or vice versa), --verbose flag for detailed logging, progress indication if fetching takes time. 3) Create output directory if needed: mkdir -p /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/openrouter. 4) Test the script: cd /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts && python openrouter-models.py 2>&1 | tee /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/openrouter-test.log. 5) Verify output: check that /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/openrouter/models.md (or .json) exists, check file size is reasonable (should be >10KB for comprehensive model list), review content to verify: all major models are included (GPT-4, Claude, Llama, etc.), information is complete and well-formatted, no API errors or truncated data, proper headers/structure for readability. 6) If output is markdown, verify: proper table formatting or clear list structure, all columns aligned and readable, code blocks for JSON examples if included, links to model documentation if applicable. 7) If output is JSON, verify: valid JSON syntax (cat openrouter/models.json | python -m json.tool), complete model objects with all relevant fields, proper structure (array of models or organized by provider). 8) Test error handling: temporarily set invalid API key and verify script fails gracefully with helpful message, test network error handling if possible. 9) Document test results in /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/openrouter-test-results.txt: whether script ran successfully, number of models fetched, output format and quality, any issues encountered and how they were fixed.

[x] TASK 18: Add metadata and create comprehensive OpenRouter documentation. After Task 17 produces working extraction: 1) Enhance the models output file to include helpful metadata. If using markdown format, add header section with: "# OpenRouter Models Catalog", "Source: OpenRouter API (https://openrouter.ai)", "Last Updated: [timestamp]", "Total Models: [N]", brief description: "Complete listing of all available models on OpenRouter, including pricing, context windows, and capabilities." If using JSON format, add metadata object at top level: {"metadata": {"source": "OpenRouter API", "updated": "timestamp", "total_models": N}, "models": [...]}. 2) Consider adding filtering/sorting capabilities to the script: sort models alphabetically by name, group by provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, etc.), separate free vs paid models, highlight popular/recommended models. Implement at least basic sorting to make output more usable. 3) Create /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts/OPENROUTER_EXTRACTION_NOTES.md documenting: Purpose of the extraction, API endpoint and authentication, how to run the script, output format explanation, update frequency recommendation (weekly? monthly?), what model information is included, any limitations or caveats, troubleshooting common issues (API key not set, network errors, rate limits). 4) Create /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/openrouter/README.md as a guide for the models data: explain what this directory contains, how the data is structured, how to interpret the model information (pricing units, context window sizes, etc.), link to OpenRouter docs for more details, when this data was last updated and how to refresh it. 5) Verify all documentation is clear and helpful for someone discovering this repo.

[ ] TASK 19: Update main README.md to include OpenRouter models and verify complete repository state. After OpenRouter extraction is complete (Tasks 16-18): 1) Open /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/README.md for editing. 2) In "Available Documentation" section, add: "- **ðŸ”„ OpenRouter Models** (`openrouter/`) - Complete catalog of available models on OpenRouter". 3) In "Update Specific Documentation" section, add: "# Update OpenRouter models catalog\npython3 update-scripts/openrouter-models.py". 4) In "Available Scripts" table, add row: "| openrouter-models.py | **OpenRouter models fetcher** - fetches complete model catalog via API | Live API integration, model pricing and specs, [format] output |" (fill in actual format - JSON or markdown). 5) In "Repository Structure" section, add: "â”œâ”€â”€ openrouter/                         # OpenRouter models catalog". 6) In "Statistics" section, add count: "- **[N] models** in OpenRouter catalog" (get actual count from output). 7) Update master update.sh script if it exists at /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/update-scripts/update.sh to include the new scripts: add line to run perplexity-docs.py, add line to run openrouter-models.py, ensure proper error handling and logging. 8) Review entire README.md for completeness and accuracy: verify all mentioned scripts exist and work, check that all directory paths are correct, ensure statistics are up to date, confirm usage examples are accurate. 9) Test README instructions: try running one or two of the example commands to verify they work as documented. 10) Create final verification checklist in /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs/tmp/final-repo-verification.txt documenting: all documentation directories that should exist (circuitpython, claude-code-sdk, notion, perplexity, openrouter), all extraction scripts that should exist (with brief description of each), README completeness check (all sections accurate and up to date), whether update.sh master script exists and includes all extractors.

[ ] TASK 20: Commit OpenRouter work and create final project summary. After all OpenRouter tasks (16-19) complete: 1) Check repository status: cd /Users/joe/github/llm-code-docs && git status. Should show: new directory openrouter/ with models file(s) and README.md, new update-scripts/openrouter-models.py, new update-scripts/OPENROUTER_EXTRACTION_NOTES.md, modified README.md, possibly modified update-scripts/update.sh. 2) Review changes: git diff README.md to check documentation, ls -lh openrouter/ to see extracted data. 3) Stage all changes: git add openrouter/, git add update-scripts/openrouter-models.py update-scripts/OPENROUTER_EXTRACTION_NOTES.md, git add README.md, git add update-scripts/update.sh (if modified). 4) Create detailed commit: git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
