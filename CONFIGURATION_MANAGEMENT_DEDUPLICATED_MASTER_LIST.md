## Research Methodology

Consolidated from four research documents created during independent sub-agent research:
1. **CONFIGURATION_MANAGEMENT_TOOLS_COMPREHENSIVE.md** - 157 tools
2. **CONFIGURATION_SERVERS_AND_MANAGEMENT.md** - 150+ tools
3. **APPLICATION_CONFIGURATION_FRAMEWORKS.md** - 200+ tools
4. **Supporting CSV catalogs** - Specifications and metadata
