KEY FINDINGS FROM 2025 RESEARCH
================================

PERFORMANCE LEADERS:
✓ Highest Throughput: Aerospike (9-10x scaling)
✓ Best Latency: Aerospike (P99: 436-2,979ms)
✓ Best Writes: Dragonfly (12-13x scaling)
✓ Best Multi-core: Valkey (1.19M req/sec)
✓ Embedded: Pogocache (>100M ops/sec)

OPEN-SOURCE MOMENTUM:
✓ Redis licensing change prompted community response
✓ Valkey (AWS-backed) emerging as Redis replacement
✓ Dragonfly gaining adoption with Redis compatibility
✓ Pogocache bringing innovation with multi-protocol support
✓ All major tools have BSD/Apache OSS alternatives

CLOUD TRENDS:
✓ Managed services (ElastiCache, Memorystore) becoming standard
✓ Edge caching (Cloudflare, Fastly) essential for global apps
✓ Serverless caching (Pinecone) gaining adoption
✓ Multi-cloud strategies driving vendor neutrality

AI/ML SPECIALIZATION:
✓ Vector databases essential (Pinecone, Weaviate adoption accelerating)
✓ Predictive caching reducing miss rates by 40%
✓ Model serving requires specialized storage (FSx for Lustre)
✓ Embeddings as new cache layer tier

ARCHITECTURE EVOLUTION:
✓ Three-tier caching (L1+L2+L3) now standard
✓ Stampede protection (FusionCache) built-in
✓ Tag-based invalidation replacing simple TTL
✓ Event-driven warming replacing lazy loading

PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:
✓ Multi-tier caching: 40-80% efficiency gains
✓ Predictive warming: 40% reduction in cache misses
✓ Single-threaded (Redis) → multi-threaded (Dragonfly/Valkey/Aerospike)
✓ Hybrid memory (DRAM+SSD) proving successful at scale

QUICK DECISION FRAMEWORK
========================

SELECT BY SCALE:
- Small (1 server): Redis or Memcached
- Medium (2-10): Redis + Memcached cluster
- Large (100+): Distributed Redis + Aerospike + CDN
- Enterprise (1000+): Dragonfly + Aerospike + Multi-CDN + Vector DB

SELECT BY PRIORITY:
- Performance: Aerospike > Dragonfly > Valkey > Redis
- Simplicity: Memcached > Cloudflare > Redis
- Open-source: Valkey > Dragonfly > Varnish > Weaviate
- Managed: ElastiCache > Memorystore > Azure Cache
- Cost: Pogocache > Memcached > Bunny CDN

SELECT BY USE CASE:
- Static content: Cloudflare or Fastly
- Sessions: Redis/Valkey
- API responses: FusionCache or ElastiCache
- Database queries: Redis (L1) + Memcached (L2)
- Embeddings: Pinecone or Weaviate
- Rate limiting: Redis

CACHE ARCHITECTURE LAYERS:
L1 (In-Memory):       <1ms    Redis/Valkey per instance
L2 (Distributed):     10-50ms Memcached/DynamoDB shared
L3 (Persistent):      100-500ms Database/Vector DB
Browser/CDN:          10-150ms Cloudflare/Fastly edge

RECOMMENDED CACHING PATTERNS:
✓ Cache-Aside: Read-heavy, simple, works everywhere
✓ Write-Through: Critical data, consistency-first
✓ Write-Behind: Non-critical, high-write scenarios
✓ Refresh-Ahead: Predictive, eliminates misses
✓ Tag-Based: Complex dependencies, Varnish model

MONITORING ESSENTIALS:
✓ Hit rate >90% for hot data
✓ Eviction rate indicates cache size issues
✓ Response time gap = cache efficiency
✓ Memory usage <80% optimal
✓ Staleness measured against TTL
